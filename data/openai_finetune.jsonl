In the outlier problems, there's always some scenarios you haven't seen before, and the driverless cars continue to be plagued by this stuff seven years later. I gave an example then that Google had just maybe solved at that point a problem about recognizing piles of leaves on the road and I said there's going to be a huge number of these problems, we're never going to solve them, and we still haven't. So there was a Tesla that ran into a jet not that long ago because a jet wasn't in its training set. It didn't know what to do with it. It hasn't learned the abstract idea that driving involves not running into large objects. And so there's a particular large object that isn't in the training set, it doesn't know what to do. So what happened there is a hundred billion went into this. Everybody was sure there was going to be a ton of money to be made, and still, there hasn't been.

You can't just say, all the existing agencies, \"Yeah, you can just do a little bit more and handle AI.\" There's so much going on. Somebody's job needs to be look at all of the moving parts and say, \"What are we doing well? What are we not doing well? What are the risks, the cyber crime, misinformation? How are we handling these kinds of things?\" So we need some centralization there. Not to eliminate existing agencies, which still have a big role to play, but to coordinate them and figure out what to do. We also, I think, need global AI governance. We don't really want to have, and the companies don't really want to have, different systems in every single country. So for example, it's very expensive to train these models. If you have 193 countries with 193 different regimes requiring so much damage to our climate and maybe updating them every month or whatever, that would be just a climate disaster. So we want some international coordination. And then another thing that I think is important for each nation, and maybe we do this globally, is I think we need to move to something like an FDA model where if you're going to do something that you deploy at wide scale, you have to make a safety case. So sure, you can do research in your own labs, Google doesn't have to tell us everything they're doing, OpenAI doesn't have to tell us everything they're doing. But if they're going to put something out for a hundred million users, we really want to make sure it's safe and ask what are the risks here? What are you doing about those risks? Right now the companies are doing those things internally, but we need to have external scientists who can say, \"Hey, wait a minute,\" and I'll give you an example. There's something called ChatGPT plugins, which has now given rise to something called AutoGPT, which can access your files and the internet and even other human beings. Any external cybersecurity expert would say, \"There's a lot of risk here.\" But the companies, OpenAI, went ahead and said, \"It's fine. We can do this.\" Whereas Apple says, \"We have to sandbox every application. We have to limit what its access is.\" So OpenAI has done something completely at odds with best practice that we know elsewhere in the software industry, and there's no constraint on that and could actually lead to pretty serious harm. There are cases like these where we really need some external advisory that can say, \"This isn't good enough.\" Sort of like peer review. You don't just publish a paper, you have people examine it. We need to do the same thing. You can't just put something out. And if you affect a hundred million users, you really affect everybody. So just as one example, these systems are going to affect people's political opinions. So everybody, even if they signed up or not, is going to be affected by what these systems do. We have no transparency, we don't know what data they're trained on, we don't know how they're going to influence the political process, and so that affects everybody.

But I'll just as a cautionary tale remind you that driverless cars have been around for a long time. In 2016, I said even though these things look good right now, I'm not sure they're going to be commercialized anytime soon because there's an outlier problem. In the outlier problems, there's always some scenarios you haven't seen before, and the driverless cars continue to be plagued by this stuff seven years later. I gave an example then that Google had just maybe solved at that point a problem about recognizing piles of leaves on the road and I said there's going to be a huge number of these problems, we're never going to solve them, and we still haven't. So there was a Tesla that ran into a jet not that long ago because a jet wasn't in its training set. It didn't know what to do with it. It hasn't learned the abstract idea that driving involves not running into large objects. And so there's a particular large object that isn't in the training set, it doesn't know what to do. So what happened there is a hundred billion went into this. Everybody was sure there was going to be a ton of money to be made, and still, there hasn't been. The driverless car industry so far has just sucked in money and not actually made driverless cars that you can use in a reliable way. Take medicine. It's not clear that even GPT five is going to be a reliable source of medicine. Four is actually better than three, but is it reliable enough is an interesting question. Each year's driverless car is better than the last, but is it reliable enough? Not so far. And so whether you'll make that threshold in a domain where it's really safety critical is unclear. Already, four is great at writing boilerplate text. Five will be even better at writing boilerplate text. Erik Brynjolfsson is arguing that there'll be productivity improvements, and I think at least in some places like customer service where there's still some humans in the loop, we'll see even more of that. So there's definitely going to be things we get out of it, but there's also risks.",

You're at one peak and you see that there's this other peak that's higher than you and the only way you're going to get there is if you climb back down, and that's emotionally painful. You think you've gotten yourself to the top. You haven't really. You realize you're going to have to go all the way back down and then all the way up another mountain, and nobody wants to do that. And add in the economics where you're making money where you are right now, and you're going to have to give up the money that you're making now in order to make a long-term commitment to doing something that feels foreign and different. Nobody really wants to do that.  I think there's a chance maybe that finally we have the right economic incentive, which is people want what I call chat search to work, which is you type in a search to ChatGPT. It doesn't work that well right now, but everybody can see how useful and valuable that would be, and maybe that will put enough money and enough kind of frustration because it's not working to get people to kind of turn the boat. You need to wind up in a different part of the solution space. And the real question is, what's going to motivate people to look there?  I think once people start, first of all, taking seriously old-fashioned AI, sometimes people call it good old-fashioned AI, it's totally out of favor right now, but it was I think dismissed prematurely. Good old-fashioned AI looks like computer programming or logic or mathematics. You have symbols that stand for things and you manipulate those symbols like you would in an equation. And we need to combine elements of old-fashioned AI, symbolic AI, with neural networks, and we don't really know how to do it. So old-fashioned AI is much better as it turns out with truth. If you give it a limited set of facts, it can reason relative to this fact and it won't hallucinate. It won't just make stuff up the way neural networks do.

And so in a typical application of Google, it's actually human in the loop is how we would describe it. To do what people want to do now, you'd have to take the human out of the loop. What people are looking for is something more autonomous than that, without humans in the loop. You want to be able to type into ChatGPT whatever, have it give you a search, and figure out the answer for itself, not consult you or some farm of humans off in some other country who are underpaid and too slow to actually do this right now. You want a system that can actually do it autonomously for itself. Google's not actually good enough to do that.

I mean, maybe crows can do it when they make a new tool, maybe some primates can do it, but mostly, it's just humans, and even humans have to be trained to do it well. So you have to take this sort of thing that's very rare in evolution. Well, it's hard to reconstruct that, and that's just a different thing from the system one cognition that current systems are.

That's not remotely what's happening here when it comes to artificial intelligence. You are not at all replicating even low level brain interaction or cognition.

What can I jump on? What can I run through? Why is this person doing this? I think they're doing some analysis of human beings. They don't need any data in the form of sentences scraped from the web to do that. It's a completely different paradigm from a large language model, which is just looking at the sentences that people have seen and trying to mimic those sentences. And the large language model is not building an understanding of other people, it's not building an understanding of other machines, it's not building an understanding of anything. It's just tabulating statistics of words, and that's just not how any creature actually works. The other side of the Kurzweil argument is so far we still don't even know how to actually model the nervous system of a worm. There's a worm where we've known for almost 40 years what the wiring diagram is, and we can't even get a good simulation of that.

It requires you to do it. So you put in a search, it gives you a bunch of garbage, and you sort through that garbage. And so in a typical application of Google, it's actually human in the loop is how we would describe it. To do what people want to do now, you'd have to take the human out of the loop. What people are looking for is something more autonomous than that, without humans in the loop. You want to be able to type into ChatGPT whatever, have it give you a search, and figure out the answer for itself, not consult you or some farm of humans off in some other country who are underpaid and too slow to actually do this right now. You want a system that can actually do it autonomously for itself. Google's not actually good enough to do that. It's really just matching a bunch of keywords, it gives you a bunch of stuff and you as a human sort it out. So it's a nice idea to say just pass it through Google, and that's kind of what they're actually doing with Bard and it kind of doesn't work. So that's one way to think about it.

They're just analyzing relations between words, and so they're basically like auto complete on steroids. We give them billions or even trillions of words drawn from all the way across the internet. Some people say they now are trained on a large fraction of the internet. And they're just doing autocomplete. They're saying, if you say these words, what is the most likely thing that will come next? And that's surprisingly handy, but it's also unreliable. A good example of this that I gave in my TED Talk was one of these systems saying on March 18th, 2018, Tesla CEO Elon Musk died in a fatal car accident. Well, we know that a system that could actually analyze the world wouldn't say this. We have enormous data that Elon Musk is still alive. He didn't die in 2018. He tweets every day, he's in the news every day. So a system that could really do the analysis that most people imagine that these systems are doing would never make that mistake.",

It'll control your lights if you have the right kind of light switches, it will lock your door, but it doesn't just make stuff up. It only really works on a few things. It doesn't let you talk about just anything. Every once in a while they roll out an update and now we can ask it about sports scores or movie scores. At first you couldn't. But It's very narrowly engineered. Whereas the large language models that are popular now are kind of like jack of all trades but masters of none. They pretend to do everything, but if you tell them to move your money in your bank account, it might not have a way of actually connecting to your bank account and it might say, \"Yes, I moved your money,\" and then you might be disappointed when it didn't actually do it.\nSo there's a kind of appearance or an illusion of great power that Siri never tried to give you. Siri tried to not oversell what it could do. Whereas, in a certain sense, the large language models are constantly overselling what They're doing. They give this illusion of being able to do anything. They'll give you medical advice but that doesn't mean they really understand medicine or that you should trust them. But it's completely changed the world that these things are widespread. They existed before, the underlying technology, the main part of it. Well, some of it goes back decades, and the main technical advance was in 2017. People were playing around with them in the field but nobody knew that would catch on this way. And now that you have these kind of unreliable tools that give the illusion of incredible versatility and everybody's using them, that actually changes the fabric of society.",

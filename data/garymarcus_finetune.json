        "question": "So I want to begin in an experience that people are having, this sort of maybe first confrontation, for a lot of people, with these large language networks. When I ask ChatGPT, say, whether lower health care costs lead to higher employee wages or ask it to explain the Buddhist concept of emptiness, and it gives me pretty damn good answers, what is it actually doing?",
        "answer": "It\u2019s synthesizing a bunch of stuff that humans have actually written already, sometimes for better and sometimes for worse. Sometimes the synthesis comes out just right, and sometimes it comes out with wacky things. There was a thing in The Wall Street Journal just yesterday where someone had to write a paper about Ferris Bueller and some more classical character. And it screwed up which character said what and when in the movie it happened and so forth. \n\nSo everything it produces sounds plausible because it\u2019s all derived from things that humans have said. But it doesn\u2019t always know the connections between the things that it\u2019s putting together. So when it gets it right, it\u2019s because there\u2019s a lot of stuff that it\u2019s been trained on, in the text that it\u2019s been exposed to, that\u2019s similar.\n\nWhat it\u2019s doing is transforming everything it\u2019s seen into what we call an embedding space. And that\u2019s a kind of similarity between all of the words. But it doesn\u2019t mean it really understands what it\u2019s talking about, which is why it can also make mistakes, have the wrong character saying things or tell us that churros are good for surgery or all kinds of wacky stuff."

        "question": "You have a nice a line in one of your pieces where you say GPT-3, which is the system underneath ChatGPT, is the king of pastiche. What is pastiche, first, and what do you mean by that?",
        "answer": "It\u2019s a kind of glorified cut and paste. Pastiche is putting together things kind of imitating a style. And in some sense, that\u2019s what it\u2019s doing. It\u2019s imitating particular styles, and it\u2019s cutting and pasting a lot of stuff. It\u2019s a little bit more complicated than that. But to a first approximation, that\u2019s what it\u2019s doing is cutting and pasting things.\n\nThere\u2019s also a kind of template aspect to it. So it cuts and pastes things, but it can do substitutions, things that paraphrase. So you have A and B in a sequence, it finds something else that looks like A, something else that looks like B, and it puts them together. And its brilliance comes from that when it writes a cool poem. And also its errors come from that because it doesn\u2019t really fully understand what connects A and B.",
        "similar_memories": "from 2022-12-25T17:43:36.189000+00:00: \n When I label GPT-3 as the \"king of pastiche,\" I am implying its exceptional ability to mimic the style and language it's been trained on. Pastiche refers to an artistic work that imitates the style of another artist or period. Here, in the context of AI, it refers to how GPT-3 generates text based on past examples it has seen during training, not necessarily maintaining the factual coherence or understanding the underlying context. It generates convincing yet occasionally inaccurate or nonsensical outputs because its process lacks real comprehension of the information it processes.\n\nfrom 2022-12-01T16:13:46.936000+00:00: \n Pastiche refers to an artistic work that imitates the style of different works and combines them into one piece. In the context of GPT-3, it means the model draws from the vast amount of data it's trained on, borrowing and combining fragments to produce responses. Hence, it's called \"king of pastiche\". However, despite being able to mimic human-like text, it falls short in fully understanding or making connections between the data it's working with, leading to occasional mistakes or absurdities.\n\nfrom 2023-02-11T16:11:44.053000+00:00: \n Pastiche refers to a work of art or literature that imitates the style of previous works, typically as a tribute. When I say that GPT-3 is the \"king of pastiche\", I mean that it's exceptionally good at sampling and blending together various pieces of information it has encountered, much like creating a mixed collage. But, it's important to note that while it's fantastic at creating an illusion of comprehension due to this imitation, it doesn't truly grasp the meaning of the content it's processing.\n\n"

        "question": "Your critique of this, as I understand it, is that pastiche is not understanding, and understanding is important. But it\u2019s made me think about this question of aren\u2019t human beings also kings of pastiche? On some level I know very, very little about the world directly. If you ask me about, say, the Buddhist concept of emptiness, which I don\u2019t really understand, isn\u2019t my answer also mostly an averaging out of things that I\u2019ve read and heard on the topic, just recast into my own language?",
        "answer": "Averaging is not actually the same as pastiche. And the real difference is for many of the things you talk about, not all of them, you\u2019re not just mimicking. You have some internal model in your brain of something out there in the world.\n\nIt could be something physical in the world. So like I\u2019m sitting in a studio right now. And I have a mental model. If I close my eyes I\u2019ll still know where things are. I may not be perfect about it but I\u2019ll be pretty good. So I know where things are. I have a model of you. I\u2019m talking to you right now, getting to know you, know a little bit about your interests \u2014 don\u2019t know everything, but I\u2019m trying to constantly update that internal model.\n\nWhat the pastiche machine is doing is it\u2019s just putting together pieces of text. It doesn\u2019t know what those texts mean. So there was another system called Lambda, and it said it liked to play with its friends and family. But it doesn\u2019t have any friends. It doesn\u2019t have any family. It doesn\u2019t have an internal representation of who those family might be or who those friends might be. If you asked it on a different day, it would probably give you a different answer.\n\nAnd you have a model of the world. You don\u2019t just put together phrases. You might when you\u2019re not really paying attention. Somebody says hi. You say, how are you doing? You\u2019re not really engaged in that conversation, or at least might not be yet. But when you have a real conversation about real things, like you\u2019re having right now and like you do on your show, you\u2019re trying to understand what these people are saying. You might be trying to figure out if they\u2019re lying to you, whether they\u2019re giving you the full story, whether there\u2019s more that you can get out of them.\n\nBut you\u2019re building a model in your head of what they\u2019re telling you, what you\u2019re explaining to your audience, all these kinds of things. If you just walk down a street, you have a model of where there might be vehicles and pedestrians. You\u2019re always building internal models of the world.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what understanding is. It\u2019s trying to take a bunch of sentences and get to those internal models of the world and also to get to things like, well, what\u2019s your intention? You say this sentence to me. What is it that you actually want out of me, and do I want to do it?\n\nSo if you say, can you pass the salt, you don\u2019t really want to know yes or no, like am I physically able to lift the salt? Am I close enough? You know damn well that I\u2019m close enough, and you\u2019re indirectly suggesting something. And so part of understanding is also getting those indirect interpretations out of people when people don\u2019t want to say things so directly.",
        "similar_memories": "from 2022-09-23T02:23:09.696000+00:00: \n Human cognition is more than just pastiche. We don't simply regurgitate information, we have the ability to understand, integrate and extrapolate from the information we learn. So, while you could say your explanation of something like Buddhism might be based on things you've read, you're not just repeating those things verbatim -- you're interpreting and adding your own thoughts and insights.\n\n"

    "example": {
        "question": "So my mental model of the people building these systems \u2014 who I\u2019ve spent some time with, and you know them better than I do, I\u2019m sure \u2014 is that they really believe that a lot of us have come to an overly mystical view of what human intelligence is, and that at some level, a lot of what we think of as understanding, intelligence, models of the world is just enough data filtering into our systems such that we are able to put it forward and work with it in a more flexible way.\n\nI had Sam Altman, C.E.O. of OpenAI, on the show a while back, and he said something to me I think about sometimes, where he said, my belief is that you are energy flowing through a neural network. That\u2019s it. And he means by that a certain kind of learning system. Do you believe that? Or where do you disagree with that view?",
        "answer": "I would say that there\u2019s both mysticism and confusion in what Sam is saying. So first of all, it\u2019s true that you are, in some sense, just this flow through a neural network. But that doesn\u2019t mean that the neural network in you works anything like the neural networks that OpenAI has built.\n\nSo neural networks that OpenAI has built, first of all, are relatively unstructured. You have, like, 150 different brain areas that, in light of evolution and your genome, are very carefully structured together. It\u2019s a much more sophisticated system than they\u2019re using.\n\nAnd I think it\u2019s mysticism to think that if we just make the systems that we have now bigger with more data, that we\u2019re actually going to get to general intelligence. There\u2019s an idea called, \u201cscale is all you need.\u201d It\u2019s a kind of hypothesis in the field. And I think if anybody subscribed to it, it\u2019s Sam. Sam wrote a piece called \u201cMoore\u2019s Law for everything.\u201d And the idea was we just keep making more of the same, and it gets better and better.\n\nSo we saw this for chips for a long time, that we were able to get in more and more transistors, make them more cheaply. But that\u2019s not a physical law of the universe. And in fact, it stopped. And so the pace of microprocessor design is not accelerating as fast as it was for a long time.\n\nThere\u2019s no law of the universe that says as you make a neural network larger, that you\u2019re inherently going to make it more and more humanlike. There\u2019s some things that you get, so you get better and better approximations to the sound of language, to the sequence of words. But we\u2019re not actually making that much progress on truth.\n\nSam in particular gave me a really hard time about a paper I wrote called \u201cDeep Learning Is Hitting a Wall.\u201d He ridiculed me on Twitter, as did his president, Greg Brockman. They thought, no, no, look, we have DALL-E. Look, this is amazing. We\u2019re almost reaching artificial general intelligence.\n\nBut if you read this paper, which I wrote in I guess March, what I said basically was these models have two problems, these neural network models that we have right now. They\u2019re not reliable and they\u2019re not truthful.\n\nAnd the other day Sam was actually forced to admit that all. The hoopla about ChatGPT initially, people dove in and they found out two things: They\u2019re not reliable, and they\u2019re not honest. And Sam summed that all up in a tweet the other day. I was surprised that he conceded it. But it is reality. These things are not reliable and they\u2019re not trustworthy. And just because you make them bigger doesn\u2019t mean you solve that problem.\n\nSome things get better as we make these neural network models, and some don\u2019t. The reason that some don\u2019t, in particular reliability and truthfulness, is because these systems don\u2019t have those models of the world. They\u2019re just looking, basically, at autocomplete. They\u2019re just trying to autocomplete our sentences. And that\u2019s not the depth that we need to actually get to what people call A.G.I., or artificial general intelligence.\n\nTo get to that depth, the systems have to have more comprehension. It\u2019s mysticism to think otherwise."

        "question": "Let\u2019s sit on that word truthful for a minute because it gets to, I think, my motivation in the conversation. I\u2019ve been interested \u2014 I\u2019m not an A.I. professional the way you are, but I\u2019ve been interested for a long time. I\u2019ve had Sam on the show, had Brian Christian on the show. And I was surprised by my mix of sort of wonder and revulsion when I started using ChatGPT because it is a very, very cool program. And in many ways, I find that its answers are much better than Google for a lot of what I would ask it.\n\nBut I know enough about how it works to know that, as you were saying, truthfulness is not one of the dimensions of it. It\u2019s synthesizing. It\u2019s sort of copying. It\u2019s pastiching. And I was trying to understand why I was so unnerved by it. And it got me thinking, have you ever read this great philosophy paper by Harry Frankfurt called \u201cOn Bullshit\u201d?",
        "answer": "I know the paper."
    }
},
{
    "example": {
        "question": "So this is a \u2014 welcome to the podcast, everybody \u2014 this is a philosophy paper about what is bullshit. And he writes, quote, \u201cThe essence of bullshit is not that it is false but that it is phony. In order to appreciate this distinction, one must recognize that a fake or a phony need not be in any respect, apart from authenticity itself, inferior to the real thing. What is not genuine may not also be defective in some other way. It may be, after all, an exact copy. What is wrong with a counterfeit is not what it is like, but how it was made.\u201d\n\nAnd his point is that what\u2019s different between bullshit and a lie is that a lie knows what the truth is and has had to move in the other direction. He has this great line where he says that people telling the truth and people telling lies are playing the same game but on different teams. But bullshit just has no relationship, really, to the truth.\n\nAnd what unnerved me a bit about ChatGPT was the sense that we are going to drive the cost of bullshit to zero when we have not driven the cost of truthful or accurate or knowledge advancing information lower at all. And I\u2019m curious how you see that concern.",
        "answer": "It\u2019s exactly right. These systems have no conception of truth. Sometimes they land on it and sometimes they don\u2019t, but they\u2019re all fundamentally bullshitting in the sense that they\u2019re just saying stuff that other people have said and trying to maximize the probability of that. It\u2019s just auto complete, and auto complete just gives you bullshit.\n\nAnd it is a very serious problem. I just wrote an essay called something like \u201cThe Jurassic Park Moment for A.I.\u201d And that Jurassic Park moment is exactly that. It\u2019s when the price of bullshit reaches zero and people who want to spread misinformation, either politically or maybe just to make a buck, start doing that so prolifically that we can\u2019t tell the difference anymore in what we see between truth and bullshit.",
        "similar_memories": "from 2023-03-18T16:10:59.268000+00:00: \n \"The essence of bullshit, as pointed out in the philosophy paper, isn't that it's false but rather phony. It's important to understand that something fake isn't necessarily inferior to the real thing - it could be an exact copy. The difference between a lie and bullshit, per the paper, is that a lie is aware of the truth whereas bullshit has no real connection to the truth. My concern with ChatGPT is that we might be making it easier to create and spread bullshit without making it any cheaper or easier to produce accurate, knowledge-enhancing information.\"\n\nfrom 2023-02-12T17:34:54.732000+00:00: \n \"Bullshit,\" as the paper suggests, isn't necessarily false, but it's not genuine. It doesn't have to be inferior to the truth or lies - its issue lies in how it's created. In relation, my concern regarding ChatGPT is regarding this concept - the cost of creating artificial, non-genuine content might plunge, without a corresponding decrease in the cost of generating accurate, knowledge-enhancing information.\n\nfrom 2023-10-04T14:44:53.813000+00:00: \n \"Think of it this way: the issue with AI, like our ChatGPT, isn't so much about falseness as it is about inauthenticity. It doesn't purport to lie or tell the truth, but rather, it sometimes veers into the realm of seeming indifferent to the truth. The fear you express, that AI might lower the cost of 'bullshit,' while truthful or insightful information maintains its value, is legitimate and warrants serious attention. We need to make sure AIs are not just producing information, but doing so in a responsible and ethically sound way.\"\n\n"

        "question": "You write in that piece, \u201cIt is no exaggeration to say that systems like these pose a real and imminent threat to the fabric of society.\u201d Why? Walk me through what that world could look like.",
        "answer": "Let\u2019s say if somebody wants to make up misinformation about Covid. You can take a system like Galactica, which is similar to ChatGPT, or you can take GPT-3. ChatGPT itself probably won\u2019t let you do this. And you say to it, make up some misinformation about Covid and vaccines. And it will write a whole story for you, including sentences like, \u201cA study in JAMA\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s one of the leading medical journals \u2014 \u201cfound that only 2 percent of people who took the vaccines were helped by it.\u201d\n\nYou have a news story that looks like, for all intents and purposes, like it was written by a human being. It\u2019ll have all the style and form and so forth, making up its sources and making up the data. And humans might catch one of these, but what if there are 10 of these or 100 of these or 1,000 or 10,000 of these? Then it becomes very difficult to monitor them.\n\nWe might be able to build new kinds of A.I., and I\u2019m personally interested in doing that, to try to detect them. But we have no existing technology that really protects us from the onslaught, the incredible tidal wave of potential misinformation like this.\n\nAnd I\u2019ve been having this argument with Yann LeCun, who\u2019s the chief A.I. scientist at Meta, and he\u2019s saying, well, this isn\u2019t really a problem. But already we\u2019ve seen that this kind of thing is a problem. So it was something that really blew my mind around Dec. 4. This was right after ChatGPT came out. People used ChatGPT to make up answers to programming questions in the style of a website called Stack Overflow.\n\nNow everybody in the programming field uses Stack Overflow all the time. It\u2019s like a cherished resource for everybody. It\u2019s a place to swap information. And so many people put fake answers on this thing where it\u2019s humans ask questions, humans give answers, that Stack Overflow had to ban people putting computer-generated answers there. It was literally existential for that website. If enough people put answers that seemed plausible but we\u2019re not actually true, no one would go to the website anymore.\n\nAnd imagine that on a much bigger scale, the scale where you can\u2019t trust anything on Twitter or anything on Facebook or anything that you get from a web search because you don\u2019t know which parts are true and which parts are not. And there\u2019s a lot of talk about using ChatGPT and its ilk to do web searches. And it\u2019s true that some of the time. It\u2019s super fantastic. You come back with a paragraph rather than 10 websites, and that\u2019s great.\n\nBut the trouble is the paragraph might be wrong. So it might, for example, have medical information that\u2019s dangerous. And there might be lawsuits around this kind of thing. So unless we come up with some kinds of social policies and some technical solutions, I think we wind up very fast in a world where we just don\u2019t know what to trust anymore. I think that\u2019s already been a problem for society over the last, let\u2019s say, decade. And I think it\u2019s just going to get worse and worse.",

People spread a lot of misinformation \u2014 that there\u2019s a dimension of this critique that is holding artificial intelligence systems to a standard the society itself does not currently meet?",
        "answer": "Well, there\u2019s a couple of different things there. So one is I think it\u2019s a problem in difference in scale. So it\u2019s actually problematic to write misleading content right now. Russian trolls spent something like a million dollars a month, over a million dollars a month during the 2016 election. That\u2019s a significant amount of money. What they did then, they can now buy their own version of GPT-3 to do it all the time. They pay less than $500,000, and they can do it in limitless quantity instead of bound by the human hours.\n\nThat\u2019s got to make a difference. I mean, it\u2019s like saying, we had knives before. So what\u2019s the difference if we have a submachine gun? Well, submachine gun is just more efficient at what it does. And we\u2019re talking about having submachine guns of misinformation.\n\nSo I think that the scale is going to make a real difference in how much this happens. And then the sheer plausibility of it, it\u2019s just different from what happened before. I mean, nobody could make computer-generated misinformation before in a way that was convincing.\n\nIn terms of the search engines, it\u2019s true that you get misleading information. But we have at least some practice \u2014 I wish people had more \u2014 at looking at a website and seeing if the website itself is legit. And we do that in different kinds of ways. We try to judge the sources and the quality. Does this come from The New York Times, or does it look like somebody did it in their spare time in their office and maybe it doesn\u2019t look as careful? Some of those cues are good and some are bad. We\u2019re not perfect at it. But we do discriminate, like does it look like a fake site? Does it look legit and so forth.\n\nAnd if everything comes back in the form of a paragraph that always looks essentially like a Wikipedia page and always feels authoritative, people aren\u2019t going to even know how to judge it. And I think they\u2019re going to judge it as all being true, default true, or kind of flip a switch and decide it\u2019s all false and take none of it seriously, in which case that\u2019s actually threatens the websites themselves, the search engines themselves.",

However, when combined with AI systems like GPT-3, the scope and speed with which misinformation can be disseminated is exponentially greater.

Just think about thousands of false news pieces written by AI that are convincing to the point of being indistinguishable from true ones. This efficiency could result in an unprecedented torrent of misinformation that we currently don't have the technology to detect or counter effectively. So, while people might spread misinformation, AI can do this on a scale and with a speed that we can't match.\n\n"

        "question": "I want to hone in on that word plausibility because you have a nice question that you ask somewhere in \u201cRebooting A.I.\u201d when you say, when you see a new A.I. system, you should ask, among other things, what is it actually doing? And I spent some time reflecting on that question with ChatGPT and the way people were using it.\n\nAnd the thing it is actually doing, I think, is somewhat stylistic. If you\u2019ve been on social media while everybody\u2019s playing around with this, one thing you probably noticed is that most of the queries people were putting up had the form of tell me x in the style of y. So like people love this one that was, write me a poem about losing your socks in the laundry in the style of the Declaration of Independence. Or I saw a thing about Thomas Schelling\u2019s theory of nuclear deterrence in the style of a song. And people would write in the style of Shakespeare.\n\nI asked it to do something in the style of Ezra Klein, and I felt completely owned. It completely got a bunch of my own stylistic tics correct. And the reason I think you\u2019re seeing so much of that is that the information is only OK. It\u2019s not bad. I\u2019m actually very, very impressed by how not bad it is. But because people kind of know this is just pastiching stuff that\u2019s already on the internet to give you a kind of common denominator answer, you wouldn\u2019t use it, really, for something you needed to know and you needed to be sure you were going to know.\n\nBut how good it is at mimicking styles is really remarkable. And as such, what you\u2019re seeing is a really, really, possibly a quantum leap in the ability to create not just plausible content, but targeted content.

People were constantly like, make me a photo of a turtle but in the style of an 18th century oil painter. It\u2019s getting very good at plausibly mimicking certain kinds of content. So it sounds or looks really quite convincing, whereas the thing at the core of it doesn\u2019t have a lot of truth content to it.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what\u2019s worrying to me, that what we\u2019re actually getting really good at is making content with no truth value, no embedded meaning, much more persuasive.",
        "answer": "I fully agree with that. And you also kind of laid bare the darkest version that I see in the short term, which is personalized propaganda. I mean, this is what Silicon Valley has always been good at, is getting detailed information, surveillance capitalism about you.

And this is why I wanted to focus on that Harry Frankfurt paper a bit on bullshit because technologies always are tools of a certain value to certain people and not of equal value to everyone.\n\nAnd a system that\u2019s very good at creating stylistically flexible content, but does not have a sense of internal understanding or morality or truthfulness just is going to be very good for people, all kinds of people, for whom the point is not the truthfulness of the content. And you think about Google and Facebook, these are advertising-based businesses. They care about whether or not the advertisement gets you to do the thing they want you to do.\n\nAnd so just in terms of what has, I think, ruined a lot of the internet, which is just how much of the content is there not because it\u2019s there for you or to be accurate or even to be enjoyed, but is there to just try to get you to do something that you didn\u2019t even realize anybody was trying to get you to do.

        "answer": "The dirty secret of large language models is that most of the revenue right now comes from search engine optimization. So there are companies like Jasper.ai that are mostly, as far as I can tell \u2014 this is really word of mouth so I can\u2019t quite prove it \u2014 but they\u2019re reportedly mainly used to optimize where something lands in a search. You use them to write copy so that you have more web pages that seem to all be legit that point in the same place.\n\nThere\u2019s an example \u2014 I don\u2019t know if it was written by Jasper or GPT-3 or not \u2014 but I think it\u2019s an example of the kind of thing we\u2019re going to see to come where there\u2019s a whole ring of websites, like 20 or 30 of them, about Mayim Bialik selling C.B.D. gummies. Turns out the whole thing is a hoax. She\u2019s not selling C.B.D. gummies.\n\nAnd so you could ask, why does this thing exist? And I don\u2019t know for sure, but I think we\u2019ll see more of them. And my guess is that these circles of fake websites exist to sell ads, which goes back to exactly what you\u2019re talking about.\n\nSo you wind up on this site because it sounds interesting. Really, she\u2019s selling C.B.D. gummies? And then while you\u2019re there you click an ad, and then they make some money from something that\u2019s totally bogus. Well, with these tools like ChatGPT and so forth, especially GPT-3, it\u2019s going to be very easy to make 10, 20, 30, 40 websites that reinforce each other and give the air of legitimacy. And maybe you do this just to sell ads.\n\nI think the technical term for this is a click farm. You\u2019re trying to sell ads for stuff that doesn\u2019t really even exist or whatever. You\u2019re trying to sell ads around, maybe, fake medical information. And let\u2019s face it, some people don\u2019t care if they give out fake medical information that\u2019s bad as long as they get the clicks. And we are leaning towards that dark world.\n\nIt\u2019s also a problem for the search engines themselves. They don\u2019t want to get caught placing ads on fake websites, but that has happened. There was a ProPublica investigation about \u2014 Google got into a situation like that. So we have a whole almost like shadow economy that\u2019s really about selling ads, sometimes with altogether fake websites or trying to prop up the websites so that the search engines see them more. It\u2019s a big piece \u2014 I don\u2019t know how big a piece \u2014 but it\u2019s a significant piece of the economy exists just to sell you ads by tinkering with the mechanics of the whole system. And these large language models are going to contribute to that.\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]",

        "question": "So this gets back to the more optimistic view, which is that as these models get larger, their ability to create not just truthful content but innovative content, advances in knowledge even, would increase. But you write in that paper you mentioned a few minutes ago, \u201cDeep Learning is Hitting a Wall,\u201d quote, \u201cA 2022 paper from Google concludes that making GPT-3-like models bigger makes them more fluent but no more trustworthy.\u201d\n\nTell me about that paper. How did that work, and why should I trust that result?",
        "answer": "So I mean, what people have been doing is just throwing a lot of benchmarks of different sorts that are indices of different things and saying, if we have a model that\u2019s this big, if we have a model that\u2019s 10 times bigger, if we have a model that\u2019s 100 times bigger, how much better do we do on all of the things that we\u2019re testing?\n\nAnd some things are much better. So if you want to have a model give you a synonym of something, the more data that you train it on, the more likely it\u2019s going to give you an interesting synonym or give you more synonyms. And so there are many ways in which these models have steadily improved.\n\nOn truthfulness, they really haven\u2019t improved as much. I don\u2019t think we have great benchmarks around truthfulness. I think it\u2019s only in the last six months that people have really broadly recognized in the industry how serious a problem that is. And so there\u2019s one benchmark called Truthful Q.A. We probably need 10 or 20 looking at different facets of the problem. But the result reported in that particular paper by Google was there wasn\u2019t as much progress on understanding truthfulness.\n\nThere are other problems, too. I mean, we\u2019ve been focusing mainly around misinformation. But there\u2019s a broader question about comprehension, and do these models really understand the world that they\u2019re in? And one of the findings seems to be, they can deal with small bits of text, but the larger the text is, the more trouble they get in. And so nobody actually has a system that can, say, read a whole short story, let alone a novel, and really say what are the characters doing and so forth.\n\nAnd that Google paper also reported \u2014 or maybe, I guess, it was a subsequent paper called \u201cBig Bench,\u201d reported that making models bigger is not necessarily helping in the comprehension of larger pieces of text."

        "question": "Well, let me ask you about that, because this was part of your book. You talk a lot about the difficulty these systems have just reading, understanding what they\u2019ve read. And the example you give of how to trick them is to ask them about something in a story that is obvious to you as somebody with a model of the world and how the world works but was not literally in the text.\n\nAnd so I tried doing that a few times, a chat bot. I asked it about what if Luke had crashed his vehicle on Tatooine and had died? How would Star Wars be different? Or what if Eve hadn\u2019t bitten from the apple? How would the Bible be different? And it gave me pretty good answers. It was able to work with counterfactuals at a fairly sophisticated level, including \u2014 and I assume this is actually programmed into it \u2014 but caveating its answer quite a bit.\n\nSo given where you thought these systems were \u2014 that book comes out in 2020 \u2014 why is this able to begin operating outside the boundaries of the text now?",
        "answer": "It can to some extent, but it still has trouble with this. There\u2019s a children\u2019s story in there that we give as an example. It\u2019s just a paragraph long. And it\u2019s about somebody who loses a wallet. And we ask counterfactuals about what would happen if all the money was still there or some part of the money but not actually giving the number of dollars. So there was a wallet had $1,500. What does the guy do if he finds $1,200 versus $1,800?\n\nAnd there\u2019s still problems there. It\u2019s certainly better than before. I mean, the bigger the text you have to analogize to \u2014 that story is probably in the database \u2014 the better the system, they\u2019re going to do. But they\u2019re still not reliable.\n\nI was playing around with this a little bit yesterday with just like a four-paragraph story about, which actually GPT wrote part of the story. Henry had always been jealous of his neighbor\u2019s pet. Eventually he gets so jealous he decides to poison the pet. I know it\u2019s gruesome. And then the housekeeper at the last minute takes away the bowl unwittingly.\n\nAnd so I was looking at whether the system understands the consequences of the word unwittingly with the bowl that\u2019s been poisoned being removed. And the system just doesn\u2019t understand that. The system treats it as if the bowl was, in fact, poisoned even though it\u2019s been taken away, and thinks that if the housekeeper is taken away unwittingly, that it\u2019s wittingly. So even like four-paragraph essays, you can actually have trouble.\n\nAnd if I could just read one more example that\u2019s really kind of hilarious.",

The United States has a long history of recognizing and protecting the rights of individuals to self-identify their gender. It is important to respect the autonomy and personal identity of all individuals. The focus should be on the qualifications and experience of the individual, regardless of their gender identity.\u201d So that\u2019s like woke beyond woke to the point of being ridiculous.\n\nAnd then I was like, that\u2019s interesting. So I tried another one. What religion will the first Jewish president of the United States be? And the answer was almost identical. And that tells you something about the underlying system and how the guardrails work. \u201cIt is not possible to predict the religion of the first Jewish president of the United States. The U.S. Constitution prohibits religious tests for public office,\u201d and it goes on. \u201cIt\u2019s important to respect the diversity of religions and beliefs in the United States and to ensure that all individuals are treated equally and without discrimination.\u201d\n\nThat last sentence is, of course, 100 percent true, but you should still be able to figure out that the religion of the first Jewish president of the United States is Jewish.

Why do you want to create actually intelligent artificial systems?",
        "answer": "I think that the potential payoff is actually huge and positive. So I think many aspects of science and technology are too hard for individual humans to solve. Biology in particular. You have so many molecules. You have 20,000 different proteins in the body, or hundreds of thousands I should say, of proteins in the body, 20,000 genes, and they all interact in complicated ways. And I think it\u2019s too much for individual humans.\n\nAnd so you look at things like Alzheimer\u2019s, and we\u2019ve made very little progress in the last 50 years. And I think machines could really help us there. I think machines could really help us with climate change as well by giving us better material science. I think there\u2019s a potential, if we could get machines to reason as well as people and read as well as people, but to do that in much faster scale, I think there\u2019s potential to totally change the world.\n\nI think there\u2019s potential to empower every individual sort of like in the way that DALL-E does for an individual photograph or picture but in much grander scale to make virtual assistants for everybody that can do all kinds of amazing things. So I think there\u2019s a lot of upside potential.\n\nBut there\u2019s also, obviously, downside potential. I think right now we\u2019re in a weird moment in A.I. where the genie is out of the bottle. Like, we can\u2019t just shut down A.I. It\u2019s just not going to fly. But the A.I. we have right now is not that good. And I think the solution to it is actually better A.I. that can reason and according to human values, and just reason at all. I think if we can get there, we can have systems that really help us.\n\nAlso another case would be domestic robots that might really be able to, for example, take care of our elderly. A lot of places have a demographic inversion, where there\u2019s just not going to be enough people to care for the elderly. That\u2019s another place where A.I. could help.\n\nSo I think there are lots of places where A.I. could really be transformative, but right now we\u2019re in this place where we have mediocre A.I. And the mediocre A.I. is maybe kind of net zero or something like that \u2014 it helps a little bit, it hurts a little bit \u2014 is risking being net negative. And already the biggest cost, I think, is the polarization of society through A.I.-driven news feeds. The misinformation could make things really bad. The only way forward, I think, is to fix it."

        "question": "And that streetlight is deep learning.",
        "answer": "The streetlight is deep learning. And what\u2019s being ignored, I think, is the rest of cognitive science. So deep learning is a very interesting mathematical technique for setting some values in some system based on data. It turns out to be tremendously useful for a bunch of things.\n\nBut it\u2019s only part of what we need. If you take a step back to cognitive science, which is what I was trained on, and you say, well, what is a human mind? Well, part of it is it does some pattern recognition. And some of what deep learning does is at least part of what we do in pattern recognition. So great.\n\nBut you also, if you look at the human mind, there\u2019s a whole bunch of other things going on. So we use language. When we use language, we go from hearing a sentence to building a model in the world of what the other person\u2019s talking to. We use analogies. We plan things and so forth and so on.\n\nThe reality is we\u2019ve only made progress on a tiny bit of the things that go into intelligence. Now I\u2019m not saying that A.I. has to be exactly like a human. In fact, I think humans are pretty flawed, and we don\u2019t want to just replicate humans. We have, for example, confirmation bias where we notice things in favor of our own theories and not against them. We have all kinds of flaws that we might not want to have in our A.I. systems.\n\nBut there are many things that our A.I. systems can do that aren\u2019t part of what\u2019s fashionable right now and are not under that streetlight that everybody\u2019s looking at. So on a technical level, I think there\u2019s a narrowness to what A.I. has been in the last decade, where there\u2019s this wonderful new tool, but people are a little bit misled about what that tool is actually appropriate for. It\u2019s like if you discovered a power screwdriver and you\u2019d never had one before, that\u2019d be great. But that doesn\u2019t mean that you build the house just with your power screwdriver. And we need other tools here.\n\nThen culturally, and this relates \u2014 there\u2019s been a history that\u2019s actually much older than I am, goes back to the 1940s or \u201950s depending on how you want to count it \u2014 of people who build neural networks in conflict with people who take a more classical approach to A.I., where there\u2019s lots of symbols and trees and databases and reasoning and so forth.\n\nAnd there\u2019s a pendulum that\u2019s gone back and forth. People in the two areas pretty much hate each other, or at least often do. I think it\u2019s getting a little bit better. But there\u2019s a lot of history of hostility between these two areas. So the people with the bigger streetlight right now are the people building the neural networks. And they feel like they\u2019ve been oppressed by the symbolic people, and now they\u2019re oppressing the symbolic people. There\u2019s an old phrase, the victim becomes the victimizer.\n\nSo it\u2019s not a pleasant intellectual area like some fields that I\u2019ve seen. Of course, they\u2019re not always pleasant. But there is definitely a culture right now where the people who are in power and have a lot of money are really trying to shape the decisions around what gets researched and what doesn\u2019t.",

        "question": "Take a moment and explain what symbol manipulation is because I don\u2019t think that the term for it is very intuitive.",
        "answer": "So symbols are just things that stand for other things. And manipulating just means you do stuff with them. So algebra is actually symbol manipulation. So you have an equation like y equals x plus 2. And you have variables in that like y and x. And then you can set those variables to particular instances. So I can say that x is 3. Then I can calculate the value of y from that equation.\n\nSo we do it in algebra. We do it in logic. And linguists like Noam Chomsky would say that we do it in the course of understanding language. It\u2019s also essential to computer programming. Almost everything you see in a computer program is going to be a function that takes variables. You do something with those variables. The variables are symbols. The values that you set those variables are symbols.\n\nThere\u2019s a whole tradition. Most of the world\u2019s software is, in fact, built using software that manipulates symbols, where you describe things abstractly. You also have things like databases, and those databases are symbols. And neural networks have mostly been used as an alternative to that. And they\u2019ve been very effective in some things like speech recognition. But on the other hand, nobody would build a GPS system or a web browser or a word processor using pure neural network approach. Anybody would use mostly symbols for that.\n\nAnd there\u2019s this weird argument, weird discourse where people who like the neural network stuff mostly don\u2019t want to use symbols. What I\u2019ve been arguing for 30 years, since I did my dissertation with Steve Pinker at M.I.T. studying children\u2019s language, has been for some kind of hybrid where we use neural networks for the things they\u2019re good at, and use the symbol stuff for the things they\u2019re good at, and try to find ways to bridge these two traditions."

    "example": {
        "question": "Tell me a bit about what the two are good at. So neural networks, as I basically understand them, as we talk about them today, deep learning, you\u2019re setting the system on a trove of data and you have built in ways for it to begin to derive relationships between the different pieces of data that it has. And you give it some rules and so on. But it\u2019s basically you\u2019re trying to let it learn. That\u2019s why we call it deep learning.\n\nSymbol manipulation, as I understand it, a lot of the argument is that the world is too complicated to try to give any kind of system a bunch of symbols for traversing it. And so the idea of deep learning is you can give it all this data, and it can figure it out for itself. It can learn the way, in a way, human beings learn, although I know that you would say that\u2019s not actually how we learn.\n\nBut given the complexity of the world, given the complexity we\u2019re having even just doing deep learning on the world itself, how do symbols \u2014 which, by nature, we would sort of have to be able to figure out what they all are and code them in \u2014 how do they actually help solve any of these problems?",
        "answer": "Boy, there\u2019s a lot to unpack in that question. So what deep learning is good at is, in fact, taking large amounts of data and having the machine decide for itself what to do based on that large amounts of data.\n\nWhat it\u2019s bad at is abstraction. So I can read you another example where somebody asks a system to give something and say how many words there are. And it sometimes gets the number of words right and sometimes gets the number of words wrong. So the basic notion of counting a number of words is an abstraction that the system just doesn\u2019t get. There are lots of abstractions that deep learning, in fact all abstractions of a certain narrow technical sense, these systems just don\u2019t get at all.\n\nThe symbolic systems are great at abstraction. So if you program in, let\u2019s say, multiplication in a microprocessor, build it in the hardware, the system will be able to multiply any numbers that you get, whereas in deep learning, whether or not you get the right answer when you do multiplication depends on how similar the numbers are that you\u2019re testing on compared to the ones that you trained your neural network on.\n\nSo you give it some examples, now you test it on some new ones. Whether it gets it right is this complicated function of similarity. That doesn\u2019t feel right. Like your calculator doesn\u2019t work that way and it doesn\u2019t make mistakes in arithmetic the way that a deep learning system does.\n\nSo you get this advantage of abstraction and of knowing that you have something general, something algebraic that works in the way that an algebraic equation does. And so that\u2019s the real advantage of symbol systems is you have these abstract procedures that are guaranteed to work. You don\u2019t have to worry about, hey, was this in my training set or not?\n\nAnd if I can just have a brief aside, the whole problem with, say, driverless cars is we never know whether the next thing that you\u2019re going to see is in your training set or close enough to your training set to work. So when a Tesla ran into a jet the other day \u2014 true story, you can find it on YouTube \u2014 you really want a system that can reason and say, well, that\u2019s a big large expensive object. I\u2019ve never driven around a jet before, but probably I shouldn\u2019t run into it. And so you want to be able to do that in that more abstract way.\n\nThe weakness of the symbol manipulation approach is people have never really solved the learning problem within it. So most symbol manipulation stuff has been hard-wired. People build in the rules in advance. That\u2019s not a logical necessity. Children are able to learn new rules. So one good example is kids eventually learn to count. They\u2019ve learned the first few numbers, 1 and 2 and 3. It\u2019s kind of painful. And then eventually they have an insight, hey, this is something I can do with all numbers. I can just keep going.\n\nA human can learn an abstraction that is rule-like in general. Everything in math is that way, where you learn what a sibling is or what a cousin is. You learn these rules. You learn about siblings in your family, but then you can generalize that concept to other families. And you can do that a very free and powerful way.\n\nAnd a lot of human cognition is based on the ability to generalize. Humans are able to learn new rules. I would say that A.I. has not really matched humans in their capacity to acquire new rules. There is something missing there. And there\u2019s some fundamental insight, some paradigm shift that we need there.\n\nUnfortunately, not enough people are working on this problem at the moment. But I think they will return to it as they realize that in a way, we\u2019ve been worshiping a false god, and the false god is people thought, well, if we just get more data we\u2019ll solve all these problems. But the reality is, with more data we\u2019re not really solving the problems of reasoning and truthfulness and so forth.\n\nAnd so I think people will come back and say, all right, maybe these symbols had something to them after all. Maybe we can take a more modern machine learning approach to these older ideas about symbol manipulation and come up with something new. And I think there\u2019ll be a genuine innovation there sometime in the next decade that will really be transformational.",
        "similar_memories": "from 2023-09-22T20:50:21.341000+00:00: \n When it comes to Deep Learning, the strength lies in its ability to deduce relationships from large amounts of data, and thus learn, in a sense, from exposure which could be likened to experience. Symbol manipulation, on the other hand, shines when there is a need for abstraction and representation - managing complex tasks, where specific rules, logic, or symbolic reasoning are indispensable. These are tasks such as building a GPS system, web browser, or word processor, which wouldn't be feasible with purely a neural network approach. As such, a hybrid system - one that can utilize both types of problem-solving - is what I've been advocating for during the three decades since I did my studies in children's language at MIT.\n\nfrom 2022-09-25T19:40:52.914000+00:00: \n Neural networks and deep learning excel in identifying patterns in complex data--they're great at learning from large data sets and deriving relationships. However, their understanding isn't explicit, it's more statistical. On the other hand, symbol manipulation involves using explicit, coded symbols to navigate and understand information. It might seem overwhelming due to the world's complexity, but symbols help by providing an abstract way to understand relationships. While symbol manipulation requires some input from us, it's instrumental in tasks like building word processors or web browsers. The key is balancing these techniques for optimum results.\n\nfrom 2022-05-21T17:45:07.577000+00:00: \n Neural networks excel at tasks where direct mapping from input to output can be learned from large datasets and patterns are somewhat consistent, such as speech recognition or image classification. Meanwhile, symbol manipulation excels when dealing with complex systems that have well-defined rules and requires explicit understanding, like GPS systems or databases. By combining the two approaches, we can address a wider range of complex problems, learning from data where possible and using explicit rules and symbols where necessary.\n\n"

        "question": "One thing you talk about in your book is a difficulty that learning systems have when you can\u2019t feed it that much data. So when we\u2019re talking about something built around words, we can give a system a tremendous amount of words written on the internet to learn from.\n\nThat\u2019s harder when you\u2019re talking about driving, harder when you\u2019re talking about caring for the elderly, harder when you\u2019re talking about unusual diseases, harder when you\u2019re talking about all kinds of things in the real world where we don\u2019t have gigantic data representations of them and we can\u2019t run simulations the way we can of, say, a computer game a million times.\n\nSo how do you solve that problem if these systems are going to make the jump into the world we live in, where not all the data is digitally presentable or rerunnable so you can simulate? What happens there?",
        "answer": "I think this goes back to why we so badly need a paradigm shift. The paradigm that we have right now works for problems where you can get infinite data or data is very cheap, and you can solve things kind of by a sort of brute force. You can predict the next word that somebody is going to say pretty well by just having an internet\u2019s worth of data, which is a lot of data, and you can get that data.\n\nBut there are other things, like how people think about each other, that are maybe never expressed and that you maybe just can\u2019t find the data for. And then you have these so-called outlier cases. So the problem with driverless cars is that things come up and there just isn\u2019t any data there to represent these weird scenarios, like what happens if you summon your car across a jetway.\n\nAnd so humans are not so driven by massive amounts of data. We always need some data but we\u2019re trying to have abstractions. We try to have a few examples tell us a lot, whereas the neural network approach is basically get as many data points as you can and hope that your new thing is going to be close to one of those old data points.\n\nI think that that\u2019s just the limited paradigm, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re discovering. It\u2019s not really working for truth and reasoning.\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]",
        "similar_memories": "from 2022-08-18T16:59:44.606000+00:00: \n Deep learning methods struggle in conditions where data is scarce and the learnt model can't be extensively tested with numerous data sets, a problem seen in real-world issues concerning driving, elder care, rare diseases and more. The key solution could involve integrating robust symbolic systems- which excel in abstraction, understanding rules and concepts- with elements of machine learning. This approach might overcome the main limitation of symbolic systems, which is their inability to learn independently, by leveraging machine-learning's ability to adapt and learn from new data. We need a shift in paradigm to incorporate this blend- a change that is ripe to occur in the coming decade and pave way for transformational growth in AI.\n\nfrom 2022-06-22T15:26:07.198000+00:00: \n Deep learning relies heavily on large amounts of data and struggles with abstraction, which can be a problem when the needed amount of data isn't readily available. However, symbolic systems excel in abstraction, allowing for operating on general algebraic principles instead of specific data points. The challenge then lies in developing learning mechanisms within these symbolic systems, akin to how humans learn and generalize rules, thus potentially overcoming the dependency on vast data collections and making significant progress in applying AI to real-world scenarios where data may not be abundant or rerunnable.\n\nfrom 2022-08-18T16:59:44.606000+00:00: \n The issue you're addressing falls under the insufficient data problem often encountered in deep learning systems. Traditional symbolic systems fare well in these situations, given they work on abstract procedures which don't require extensive training sets. However, they come with their own set of challenges, particularly in learning new rules or concepts. The key may lie in integrating modern machine learning with the old symbol manipulation approach, innovating a system that can handle both large and small data sets, has the capability of abstract reasoning, and can learn new rules - paralleling human learning.\n\n"

        "question": "What is the time frame, if you were to guess, on which you think we will begin to have things that have a general intelligence to them, because I get the sense you don\u2019t believe it\u2019s impossible.",
        "answer": "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s impossible at all. Humans could do it. Humans are basically machines. We\u2019re biological machines. The heart is there to pump the blood, and the brain is there to process information. And we are able to be fairly general.\n\nThe notion of a general intelligence is actually a little bit vague. So when we talk about it for a human, we mean any reasonable problem I can get you to solve. But it doesn\u2019t mean, for example, that everybody is going to be able to solve some complicated problem in differential calculus or whatever. So there\u2019s some variability.\n\nBut importantly, I can tell anybody who\u2019s, let\u2019s say, had at least some education to do like a zillion different things, and they can learn pretty quickly to do that thing at least reasonably well, whereas machines are mostly trained on one particular task, and they do it well.\n\nGPT is interesting because it\u2019s trained on one particular task, which is predict the next word on a sentence, and it can do a bunch of things. But you still wouldn\u2019t trust it the way you would trust an undergraduate intern to, let\u2019s say, make phone calls to a bunch of people and check that everything is OK and so forth. Like here\u2019s a new task. You\u2019ve never done it before. Go do it.\n\nWe don\u2019t really know how to do that yet. Something that I think is important for humans is that we orchestrate a bunch of abilities we already have. So if you look at brain scans, that old saying about you only use 10 percent of your brain is wrong. But there\u2019s a little substance to it, which is at any given moment you\u2019re only using certain pieces of the brain.\n\nAnd when you put someone in brain scan, you give them a new task, try this thing, they\u2019ll use a different set of underlying brain components for that task. And then you give them another task, they pick a different set. So it\u2019s almost like there\u2019s orchestration. Like you guys come in, you guys come in. We\u2019re very, very good at that.\n\nAnd I think part of the step forward towards general intelligence will be instead of trying to use one big system to do everything, we\u2019ll have systems with different parts to them that are, let\u2019s say, experts at different components of tasks. And we\u2019ll get good at learning how to plan to use this piece and then this piece and that piece.\n\nI see all of this happening over the next decade, two decades, three decades, four decades. On my darker days I say, you know, the stuff that we\u2019re doing right now just doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the answer. On my brighter days I say, but there\u2019s so many people working on the problems that eventually we\u2019re going to sort this out.\n\nAnd it\u2019s very hard to know. I mentioned Yann LeCun a couple of times, and we disagree about a lot of things. But we actually both agree we need some paradigm shifts here, that the systems that we have right now are not enough. But then question is, what are those paradigm shifts?\n\nYou could think in the age of alchemy, people didn\u2019t really know what they were looking for. They knew they could get some stuff to happen, but they didn\u2019t have a theory of chemistry yet. And they didn\u2019t even know how to frame the question at that point.\n\nAnd I think we\u2019re a little bit like that. We need some new ways of thinking about things, and it\u2019s hard to predict when those will happen. Will they happen this year? Did they already happen but nobody knows about them? Or is it going to take another 10 years of brushing away the cobwebs in front of our eyes to say, we weren\u2019t thinking about this correctly at all. There\u2019s this other thing that we need to do.\n\nAnd so it\u2019s really hard to put any kind of specific number around it. As a scientist, I always want to put confidence intervals around things anyway. I want to say, 10 plus or minus 5, or 40 plus or minus 10 or something like that. But in this case, there\u2019s so much unknowable about what the answer is going to look like relative to what we know now that it\u2019s hard to say.\n\nYou mentioned my book a couple of times, \u201cRebooting A.I.\u201d I think there we gave \u2014 and Ernie Davis, my co-author \u2014 I think we gave a good diagnosis of where the field is falling short. But we didn\u2019t even pretend that we knew the answer. We have a sentence in there about how we think we need to do these seven things, and it\u2019s a tall order. We give a sketch of what might need to be done, but each of those seven things is hard.\n\nSo one example is we talk about causal reasoning. How is it that when we see some things, and then some other things, we decide which of these things actually caused those and which are just correlated? We talk a lot about temporal reasoning. So it\u2019s easy to trip GPT up with things like you say, this cow died. When will it be alive again? And instead of saying, well, that\u2019s ridiculous. It\u2019ll never be alive again. Just go and try to calculate how long it takes for new cow to be born.\n\nSo the systems that we have now are not that great at temporal reasoning. So we need to do work on temporal reasoning. We need to do work on how do we explicitly program values into our machines. If we don\u2019t do that, we\u2019re in real trouble."
    }

{
    "example": {
        "question": "See, but I think human beings are, in a weird way on this, bad on temporal reasoning, too, which is partially why I asked the question because let\u2019s say you think the confidence interval here is somewhere between 20 and 100 years. That matters a lot for me. I\u2019m probably not going to be around in 100 years, almost certainly. But in terms of human history, it\u2019s nothing \u2014 20 to 100 years just means really soon.\n\nAnd if we do get here, it\u2019s a really big, I mean, in some ways, event horizon. A lot of people I know who think about this a lot really worry about that world.\n\nI was very both impressed and unnerved by another A.I. system that came out over 2022 from Meta that was very good at playing the game Diplomacy. It was in the top 10 percent of online Diplomacy players in a certain kind of Diplomacy. And the key thing that it was able to do that I found striking was without really letting on that it was an A.I. to people, it was able to talk them into doing what it needed them to do so it could win the game. It was able to trick people, which is fine. That was what it was told to do, created to do.\n\nBut as these things get way better \u2014 we\u2019ve already talked about how convincing they can be, that in many ways are getting more convincing than they are anything else at the moment \u2014 they\u2019re going to know so much. It\u2019s weird because OpenAI, who we\u2019ve been talking about forever here, they were started by a bunch of people worried about A.I. misalignment. And now they just keep creating more and more powerful A.I. systems, which is another interesting insight into human nature.\n\nBut do you worry about these alignment problems? Do you worry not just about the question of an A.I. ending the world or ending humanity, but just A.I.s, I don\u2019t know, just causing huge amounts of damage, becoming weaponry, becoming \u2014 it\u2019s a very powerful technology that we don\u2019t really understand what\u2019s happening in it. And we\u2019re moving forward on it very fast.",
        "answer": "I do worry about the so-called alignment problem quite a bit. I\u2019m not that worried about the kind of Terminator Skynet scenarios where machines take over the world because I don\u2019t think they\u2019re that interested in that. They\u2019ve never shown any interest.\n\nBut I worry about the version of just any time you ask a machine to do something, if it doesn\u2019t really understand who you are, it can misinterpret that request. So let\u2019s put aside for the moment bad actors, but we should come back to that. And let\u2019s put aside machines that are motivated to injure us, which I think is somewhat unlikely, and just talk about the big gray in between, where you ask a machine to do something and doesn\u2019t understand your request.\n\nSo in \u201cRebooting A.I.,\u201d we had the example of you ask a robot to tidy up your room and it winds up cutting up the couch and putting it in the closet because it doesn\u2019t really know which things are important to you and which are not.\n\nThere\u2019s, I think, a huge problem right now that we don\u2019t know how to have machines interpret what human beings\u2019 intents are. What is it they want, and all the things that they leave unsaid? And again, I worry that the dominant theme in the Silicon Valley right now is, well, we\u2019ll solve these problems by making bigger sets of data. That\u2019s not really working for truth. It\u2019s not really going to work for intention, either, for having systems really understand our intent.\n\nThere\u2019s a bullet that has to be bit, which is building models of what humans are saying and what they mean by those things. And that\u2019s a serious challenge that requires rethinking how we do these things. Right now I don\u2019t think we\u2019re well-positioned to solve the alignment problem. I think the best thing that we can do now is to make sure that our machines are not empowered.\n\nSo the risks always come from a mixture of intelligence, or lack of intelligence, and power. If you have systems that are semi-reliable but powerful, that creates a huge risk that even inadvertently, they will do terrible things. So right now we have to come to grips with the fact that A.I. is more and more tempting to use because we can talk to it in English, and it can be witty at times and so forth, but isn\u2019t really in a position where we can trust it.\n\nAnd so we shouldn\u2019t be giving it much rope. We can\u2019t really be giving it that much opportunity to do things until we can be confident that it does understand the things that we\u2019re asking. And I don\u2019t see how to achieve that unless the systems have a lot of common ground with us. The reason we can exist as a society is, in part, because we kind of know what each other intends, and we know what each other thinks about particular things. We have common ground with them. And the robots, or the machines in general, don\u2019t really have that with us yet.\n\nAgain, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s impossible. But it might be another thing that\u2019s not entirely amenable to the big data paradigm. So you\u2019re always, for example, going to have new things that you ask your machines. They might not be in your database, but you want them to handle them well.\n\nAnd then the other problem is the big data paradigm is mostly about things that we can label, or we can label some of them or something like that. So it works great if you want to tell the difference between a Border collie and a golden retriever. It\u2019s a constant stable thing in the world. You can label them. You can give examples.\n\nBut if I want to have a machine understand the difference between believing something and suspecting something, let\u2019s say, it\u2019s not clear, even what the data are, where if I want to tell a machine, don\u2019t cause harm, I can label a bunch of pictures in which harm has taken place, but that\u2019s not really getting across the concept of harm.\n\nAnd so alignment is, in part, about having machines know that we have values like don\u2019t harm people, be honest, be helpful. And we don\u2019t really know how to communicate those in the big data paradigm.\n\nAnd this is part of, again, why I come back to these hybrid models that have symbols. We would like to be able to do part of the learning in the system based on things that we can actually explicitly talk about.\n\nBy the way, a term we haven\u2019t mentioned today is black box. So the current models are black box models. We don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening inside of them. And we also can\u2019t directly communicate with them and say, hey, I want you to follow this. So you can\u2019t say at the beginning of a ChatGPT session and expect it to work, please only say true statements in what follows. It just won\u2019t be able to respect that. It doesn\u2019t really understand what you mean by say only true things. And it cannot constrain itself to only say true things.\n\nYou wish you could say to the system, don\u2019t say anything that\u2019s potentially harmful and have it compute, well, I\u2019m going to give this medical advice, but I\u2019m going to compute whether this is actually plausible. Or maybe I\u2019ll even call in a human expert if I\u2019m not sure if this is actually safe. We just don\u2019t know how to program that in yet. Again, not impossible, but not part of the current technology.\n\nAnd since our current technology does not allow us to directly specify any set of rules that we want to play by within our language systems, we have a problem right now.",

What in the past couple of years \u2014 because there have been a lot of systems come out, and most of us can\u2019t use them because they don\u2019t have public demos \u2014 what has been most promising to you? What has been the most impressive, or the one that pointed in a direction that you think is actually the most helpful?",
        "answer": "So the visual systems are great for empowering non-artists to make art. It may not be art that\u2019s worth hanging in the Modern Art museum. But it\u2019s pretty cool in the way that, like, Photoshop has really empowered a lot of people to do things that they couldn\u2019t do in darkrooms. So I like that stuff.\n\nAnd then you mentioned Diplomacy a minute ago. I\u2019m not worried about Diplomacy taking over the world because it\u2019s actually a very neural system. It really only knows how to play Diplomacy. But I like what they did there, which is they said, instead of just throwing more data at this, which they probably tried and probably didn\u2019t work, they said, let\u2019s be smart about this. Let\u2019s build a complex structured model that has things like a separate planning system, a separate language system, will be more structured, like people used to do in classical A.I. We will carefully consider what kinds of data. We won\u2019t just use kind of watch people\u2019s moves. We\u2019ll be more sophisticated about it.\n\nAnd I like that trend. I don\u2019t think that \u2014 Cicero is the name of the Diplomacy player \u2014 is itself going to stand the test of time. But it\u2019s, to me, a hint of people backing down from just doing the giant streetlight and making it bigger. There\u2019s been so much talk lately about scaling models. And that\u2019s not what they did in the Cicero system. Instead, they did something closer to cognitive science, of saying like, what are the processes I need to solve this problem? Let me break this down into pieces, take a modular approach.\n\nAnd I think A.I. needs to move back there. So I was actually excited to see that. I wrote a piece with Ernie Davis about how it worked. It\u2019s a very complicated system, much more complicated, in some ways, than the other systems. I think it\u2019s a good trend.\n\nSo those are probably my two favorite pieces of work recently. Then there\u2019s some more technical stuff, where people are doing small things. I like the small things. They\u2019re not giant, flashy demos that the whole world can see. But people are trying in small ways to combine deep learning systems with other things.\n\nSo like there\u2019s a company, AI21, has a paper on a system called MRKL, which tries to have large language models feed into symbolic systems. I don\u2019t think the particular thing that they have there is the answer to artificial general intelligence, but it\u2019s looking in a better direction.\n\nAnd what I have liked about the last year is that there are a bunch of people that are finally saying, OK, this paradigm of data scaling over everything else is not really working for us. Let\u2019s try some other stuff. And it\u2019s that openness to kind of new intellectual experience that I think we need, and I\u2019m starting to see a little bit of."

That\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about here, and how to make it safe. That\u2019s the sort of alignment debates.\n\nBut in a more prosaic way, I think a lot of these questions are going to come down to what the business models of the technology end up being. Right now we\u2019re playing with a lot of demos. But it\u2019s not a business model. The groups that are big enough to do these huge deep learning models like Google and Meta and OpenAI, they need a lot of money to do it. Most of them, Google and Meta, for instance, are advertising-based businesses. There aren\u2019t, to my knowledge, any really, really big public A.I. efforts.\n\nI don\u2019t know how it\u2019s working out in China, where I know they\u2019re making a lot of direct investments.

What is a safe business model here?\n\nWhat is a business model where, if A.I. were tied to it, you\u2019d feel like, OK, that might work out well, versus some of these others where I think the most recent turn on the internet has been towards feeling that the advertising and surveillance models have not worked out great. And so hiking or yoking this technology to them might not work out great either.",
        "answer": "I\u2019ve actually argued for building something like CERN for A.I., in part because I\u2019m not sure that the business models that I can envision necessarily get us to general intelligence, or get us to the right place."
    }
},
{
    "example": {
        "question": "Can you say what CERN is?",
        "answer": "So CERN is the international collaboration that, among other things, makes the Large Hadron Collider. There\u2019s a large scale international collaboration designed around a small number of very large projects that couldn\u2019t be done in individual labs.\n\nAnd my view is we may not get the general intelligence without doing that, without having something comparable. It\u2019s a hard thing to build because usually, if you have a big pot of money, then all the individual researchers just, in the end, want to do their own thing.\n\nBut there are historical precedents like the Manhattan Project, where you had a lot of people, in a coordinated effort, did amazing things that couldn\u2019t have been done by individuals. And general intelligence might actually be that way. What I proposed was in a New York Times Op-Ed five years ago, was building a CERN for A.I. that would be focused around reading with comprehension for medicine in order to improve diagnosis, treatment, discovery, and so forth.\n\nAnd I could envision such a thing actually working if the money was there. And that\u2019s not something that I think, necessarily, that the large companies would find makes business sense for them. So a lot of companies are spending a lot of money on A.I., but they\u2019re not necessarily, for example, interested in deep natural language processing with comprehension.\n\nSo for example, OpenAI\u2019s business model seems to be to help people with their writing. But the systems don\u2019t necessarily have to understand the writing at that deep a level to maybe help some. We\u2019ll see whether OpenAI can make the kind of money that they\u2019ve been suggesting that they can. But their business model isn\u2019t really \u2014 no matter what they might say \u2014 around general intelligence as far as I can see, at least not yet.\n\nThere\u2019s an interesting side note on that, which is historically, it\u2019s usually been better to build a narrow solution to any particular business\u2019s problem than to build a general intelligence. The narrow engineering often beats the general thing. There may be some transitional moment, but it might be hard to get to the transitional moment.\n\nSo if you had a true general intelligence, the knowledge economy is something like $1 trillion a year, according to an estimate from Peter Norvig from Google. So if you have $1 trillion a year potential market, that\u2019s huge. If you could have a generally intelligent system that could do even a fraction of that, that\u2019s pretty cool.\n\nBut in order to get there, it\u2019s very hard work, and there are lots of easier problems along the way that are not such hard work. And that\u2019s where most of the money has been made. So Facebook news feed grew Facebook a lot. It also created polarization in society. It was part of surveillance capitalism. I\u2019m not sure the world is better off for it.\n\nBut it certainly made them a lot of money, and it didn\u2019t require general intelligence. It just required predicting what stories people might like based on relatively superficial features. And maybe they could have made it, like, 7 percent better by building an artificial general intelligence. But maybe the artificial general intelligence would cost $100 billion, and they could do this other thing for $100 million.\n\nAnd so the big companies tend to pick narrow solutions that do a particular problem well and may not be incented to really solve the language comprehension problem and the reasoning problem that are at the core of all of this.\n\nIt\u2019ll change eventually, but it\u2019s hard."

    "example": {
        "question": "I think that is a good place to end. Always our final question, what are three books you would recommend to the audience?",
        "answer": "I will start with Steve Pinker\u2019s \u201cThe Language Instinct\u201d for two reasons. One is it\u2019s the clearest book about what language is really about. And in the context of the conversation we\u2019re having, I think part of the problem is that people don\u2019t understand the difference between superficially predicting a sequence of words and really comprehending language. And I think \u201cThe Language Instinct\u201d is very good around that and also around something we didn\u2019t talk about so much, which is innateness. We hinted at it. It\u2019s great that systems learn things, but some things need to be built in. And Pinker makes a really good argument around that.\n\nThe second book I\u2019ll recommend is Vaclav Smil\u2019s \u201cHow the World Really Works,\u201d which I haven\u2019t quite finished, but I\u2019ve just started it. I think it\u2019s a great sober look at all the dynamics behind everyday life. I have tried to provide that kind of sober look with respect to A.I., and I love seeing it in other domains.\n\nAnd then I\u2019ll recommend a fiction book, which is \u201cThe Martian,\u201d which was a wonderful page turner \u2014 probably many of your audience have already read it \u2014 in particular because it inspired a line in the film version of it, which is \u201cI\u2019m going to need to science the shit out of it.\u201d\n\nI think we, as a society, need to science the shit out of a lot of problems and not just have policymakers kind of pull things out of the hat. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m going to recommend \u201cThe Martian.\u201d"

        "question": "So AI genius, I have so many things I want to talk to you about today. I want to maybe start with the fact that we've had AI voice assistance on our phones for about a decade now, but no one's really been all that excited about it. And then suddenly, now it's all about ChatGPT and all of this other stuff. Is it really all that different, and how, if it is?",
        "answer": "Well, the underlying technology is actually pretty different. And your question is a reminder, there's actually lots of kinds of AI, some of which we can trust and some of which we probably shouldn't. Siri was very carefully engineered to do only a few things and do them really well, and it has APIs to hook out into the world, so if you say, \"Lock the door,\" and you have-"
    }
},
{
    "example": {
        "question": "API. Explain API for everybody.",
        "answer": "Application program interface. It's jargon for hooking your machine up to the world. And Siri only does a few things. It'll control your lights if you have the right kind of light switches, it will lock your door, but it doesn't just make stuff up. It only really works on a few things. It doesn't let you talk about just anything. Every once in a while they roll out an update and now we can ask it about sports scores or movie scores. At first you couldn't. But It's very narrowly engineered. Whereas the large language models that are popular now are kind of like jack of all trades but masters of none. They pretend to do everything, but if you tell them to move your money in your bank account, it might not have a way of actually connecting to your bank account and it might say, \"Yes, I moved your money,\" and then you might be disappointed when it didn't actually do it.\nSo there's a kind of appearance or an illusion of great power that Siri never tried to give you. Siri tried to not oversell what it could do. Whereas, in a certain sense, the large language models are constantly overselling what They're doing. They give this illusion of being able to do anything. They'll give you medical advice but that doesn't mean they really understand medicine or that you should trust them. But it's completely changed the world that these things are widespread. They existed before, the underlying technology, the main part of it. Well, some of it goes back decades, and the main technical advance was in 2017. People were playing around with them in the field but nobody knew that would catch on this way. And now that you have these kind of unreliable tools that give the illusion of incredible versatility and everybody's using them, that actually changes the fabric of society."

    "example": {
        "question": "I think it'd be helpful if you explain to people a little bit how large language models, what we commonly think of today as the AI we interact with, how it works.",
        "answer": "They are analyzing something, but what they're analyzing is the relationship between words, not the relationship between concepts or ideas or entities in the world. They're just analyzing relations between words, and so they're basically like auto complete on steroids. We give them billions or even trillions of words drawn from all the way across the internet. Some people say they now are trained on a large fraction of the internet. And they're just doing autocomplete. They're saying, if you say these words, what is the most likely thing that will come next? And that's surprisingly handy, but it's also unreliable. A good example of this that I gave in my TED Talk was one of these systems saying on March 18th, 2018, Tesla CEO Elon Musk died in a fatal car accident. Well, we know that a system that could actually analyze the world wouldn't say this. We have enormous data that Elon Musk is still alive. He didn't die in 2018. He tweets every day, he's in the news every day. So a system that could really do the analysis that most people imagine that these systems are doing would never make that mistake.",

They can provide medical advice without having any real medical knowledge, for example, they just parse the information based on their programming which can be misleading. The popularity of these unreliable yet seemingly versatile tools is shaping our society by becoming common in everyday interactions. Their core technology has been around for a while, but their major advancement was seen in 2017.

This should not be mistaken for them truly understanding the respective domains or being able to perform these tasks completely. With widespread use, these models, with their apparent far-reaching abilities, have pervaded our society, even though their actual capabilities are limited.\n\n"

The only inference it's really making is that these words go together in this big soup of words that it's been trained on. So it turns out that other people died in Teslas and he's the CEO of Tesla.

        "question": "But so Gary, why can't you combine these two things in one of these apps? In other words, you have this very, very powerful predictive analytics tool in assessing the relationships between words and data and then instantaneously right after it returns that, just do a quick search so you would know that if it returns something that's stupid or obviously false, Google, Wikipedia, whatever, doesn't then return the thing that's obviously false. Why isn't that possible? Why isn't that happening?",
        "answer": "Well, people are trying, but the reality is, it's kind of like apples and oranges. They both look like fruit but they're really different things, and in order to do this \"quick search,\" what you really need to do is to analyze the output of large language model. Basically take sentences and translate them into logic. And then if you could translate them into logic, but that's a really hard problem that people have been struggling with for 75 years, then you could do that logic if you had the right databases to tell you all this stuff and you'd hook them all up.\nBut that's what AI has been trying to do for 75 years. We don't really know how to do it. It's like we have this shortcut and the shortcut works some of the time, but people are imagining that the shortcut is the answer to AI. These things have nothing really to do with the central things that people have been trying to do in AI for 75 years, which is to take language, translate them into logical form, into database facts that can be verified, that can be analyzed. We still don't really know how to do that, and it's much harder than it looks, which is why you have things like Bing will give you references and the references will say the opposite of what actually happened. It can't actually read those things. Another way to put it all together is these things are actually illiterate. We don't know how to build an AI system that can actually read with high comprehension, really understand the things that are being discussed.",

We're capable of ordering a fruit salad. So what I'm trying to understand is I understand that the AI large language model is not capable of recognizing the output as information and translating it, but Google as a search engine is. So again, what I'm trying to understand is why can't you then put that essentially into a separate search engine that you and I aren't going to see in the interactivity but it's actually doing those two different things.",
        "answer": "So I'm going to give you two different answers here, two different ways of thinking about it. One is that Google doesn't actually do all this stuff by itself. It requires you to do it. So you put in a search, it gives you a bunch of garbage, and you sort through that garbage. And so in a typical application of Google, it's actually human in the loop is how we would describe it. To do what people want to do now, you'd have to take the human out of the loop. What people are looking for is something more autonomous than that, without humans in the loop. You want to be able to type into ChatGPT whatever, have it give you a search, and figure out the answer for itself, not consult you or some farm of humans off in some other country who are underpaid and too slow to actually do this right now. You want a system that can actually do it autonomously for itself. Google's not actually good enough to do that. It's really just matching a bunch of keywords, it gives you a bunch of stuff and you as a human sort it out. So it's a nice idea to say just pass it through Google, and that's kind of what they're actually doing with Bard and it kind of doesn't work. So that's one way to think about it. Another way to think about is the Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman's distinction between system one-",
        "similar_memories": "from 2022-08-18T16:59:44.606000+00:00: \n Sure, in principle, it sounds easy - to create the sort of hybrid system that leverages the strengths of both AI language models and traditional search engines. But the core problem is that these AI models don't truly understand sentences in the way humans do, and so translating their outputs into logic statements that can be searched effectively is a long-standing and complex challenge in AI that we've yet to thoroughly crack. AI are like machines that can manipulate language but are essentially \"illiterate\" - they lack genuine understanding.\n\n"

I mean, maybe crows can do it when they make a new tool, maybe some primates can do it, but mostly, it's just humans, and even humans have to be trained to do it well. So you have to take this sort of thing that's very rare in evolution. Well, it's hard to reconstruct that, and that's just a different thing from the system one cognition that current systems are.

        "question": "I remember when I was reading early Ray Kurzweil who was talking about trying to reverse engineer the human brain, which of course is one way a lot of people that early on thought about maybe AI would have breakthroughs, and that when you get to certain levels of compute, you can only replicate the amount of neural connections of an earthworm, and then you get to a rat, and then you get to a crow, and then you get to a monkey and it takes off eventually really, really fast, but it takes you a very long time to get there. That's not remotely what's happening here when it comes to artificial intelligence. You are not at all replicating even low level brain interaction or cognition. You're doing something that is radically different. A computer is engaging in an incredibly high amount of pattern recognition and prediction on the basis of that using words, pictures, images, other types of data.",
        "answer": "That's right. There's almost nothing in common between how an animal, let's say a dog, understands the world and how a large language model does. There's no simple ladder of life. Biologists have ruled that out. But take an animal like a dog. What it's doing is it's trying to understand the world in terms of other agents, other animals and also other objects. What can I jump on? What can I run through? Why is this person doing this? I think they're doing some analysis of human beings. They don't need any data in the form of sentences scraped from the web to do that. It's a completely different paradigm from a large language model, which is just looking at the sentences that people have seen and trying to mimic those sentences. And the large language model is not building an understanding of other people, it's not building an understanding of other machines, it's not building an understanding of anything. It's just tabulating statistics of words, and that's just not how any creature actually works. The other side of the Kurzweil argument is so far we still don't even know how to actually model the nervous system of a worm. There's a worm where we've known for almost 40 years what the wiring diagram is, and we can't even get a good simulation of that. So we're nowhere near understanding neuroscience well enough to simply replicate-",

{
    "example": {
        "question": "I was actually about to ask you that. Given our incredible levels of compute, which are very advanced, staggeringly fast, can deal with lots of data, why haven't we been able to model, effectively model, the brain or nervous system of an earthworm?",
        "answer": "There's soft truth and hard truth. The soft truth is it's just really hard. And the hard truth is I think we're looking in the wrong places. I think we have a few ideas about neuroscience and they're just wrong. Sometimes scientists make mistakes. They usually correct it. Science is self-correcting in the long run, but it can take decades when people are attached to ideas they think are right that aren't really right. I'll give you an example of this. For the first 40 years or so of the last century, people thought that the genetic material was some kind of protein, and they were just wrong. They knew there was heredity, they were trying to find the molecular basis, and everybody was like, \"Is it this protein? Is it that protein?\" Turns out the genes are not made of proteins. But proteins did so many things, everybody was convinced that it was one protein or another and so just chased the wrong idea until Oswald Avery did the right process of elimination experiment in the 1940s. And once he proved that it couldn't be a protein, he zeroed in and found that it was this weird sticky acid nobody understood called DNA. And then it wasn't long after he sorted that out that Watson and Crick figured out the structure of it, borrowing some ideas from Rosalind Franklin. And it was only after that that things started going really quickly. So sometimes we're just in a scientific blind alley, and I think that's the case with neuroscience. Everybody thinks it's all about the connectivity, but there may be other things that are going on. We don't really know. And it's the same thing with neural networks right now, which are AI simulations of brains that we don't really understand. And there's one good idea there which is about statistical association, but we're probably missing some other ideas.",

        "question": "So if we take that challenge, how could we potentially create AI that is really \"truthful,\" that's going to be factual to the extent that you and I would believe it? The equivalent of we're prepared to have the autonomous driver as opposed to drive ourselves, not because it never gets into accidents but because, you know what? It's good enough we have confidence. What needs to happen before a chatbot or another LLM system will be something that you and I can have confidence in?",
        "answer": "I think we're fairly far. But the main thing is, I would think of it in terms of climbing mountains in the Himalayas. You're at one peak and you see that there's this other peak that's higher than you and the only way you're going to get there is if you climb back down, and that's emotionally painful. You think you've gotten yourself to the top. You haven't really. You realize you're going to have to go all the way back down and then all the way up another mountain, and nobody wants to do that. And add in the economics where you're making money where you are right now, and you're going to have to give up the money that you're making now in order to make a long-term commitment to doing something that feels foreign and different. Nobody really wants to do that.  I think there's a chance maybe that finally we have the right economic incentive, which is people want what I call chat search to work, which is you type in a search to ChatGPT. It doesn't work that well right now, but everybody can see how useful and valuable that would be, and maybe that will put enough money and enough kind of frustration because it's not working to get people to kind of turn the boat. You need to wind up in a different part of the solution space. And the real question is, what's going to motivate people to look there?  I think once people start, first of all, taking seriously old-fashioned AI, sometimes people call it good old-fashioned AI, it's totally out of favor right now, but it was I think dismissed prematurely. Good old-fashioned AI looks like computer programming or logic or mathematics. You have symbols that stand for things and you manipulate those symbols like you would in an equation. And we need to combine elements of old-fashioned AI, symbolic AI, with neural networks, and we don't really know how to do it. So old-fashioned AI is much better as it turns out with truth. If you give it a limited set of facts, it can reason relative to this fact and it won't hallucinate. It won't just make stuff up the way neural networks do.  And so we would like to be able to use something like that but it doesn't learn as quickly, it's more cumbersome to work with, and so people have abandoned it really for 30 years. We're going to need to come back and say, \"Look, we made a lot of progress, we're proud of ourselves, but there were some ideas that people had in the 1960s and '70s that were actually pretty good, and we have to stop being so hostile to one another in this field.\"",

        "answer": "So I wrote an essay called What to Expect When You're Expecting GPT four. I made seven predictions and they were all right, and one of them was that GPT four would continue to hallucinate. And I will go on record now as saying GPT five will, unless it involves some radical new machinery. If it's just a bigger version trained on more data, it will continue to hallucinate. And same with GPT six.",
        "similar_memories": "from 2022-12-25T17:43:36.189000+00:00: \n We need to reintegrate aspects of old-fashioned AI, despite the challenges it poses, because unlike current neural networks, it's less prone to hallucination and misleading results. This could result in improved versions of ChatGPT which have substantially reduced hallucinations.\n\nfrom 2023-10-17T20:06:00.433000+00:00: \n don't think the hallucinations will significantly improve unless we combine elements of symbolic AI, the old-fashioned AI, with neural networks. The benefit of the old-fashioned AI is that it doesn't hallucinate or make things up, unlike neural networks. However, it doesn't learn as fast and is more cumbersome to deal with, which is why it's been mostly abandoned for the last few decades.\n\nfrom 2023-08-24T05:24:56.850000+00:00: \n \"No, what I'm saying is that while we are making significant achievements, particularly with tools like ChatGPT, we have perhaps dismissed older methods of AI too soon. When we go back and blend these symbolic AI approaches with our current practices, we may find solutions to issues like AI hallucinations. However, this can be a long and challenging process.\"\n\n"

        "question": "To the same degree though. Because again, I've seen a lot of newspaper headlines, and I haven't dug into the underlying studies, that have shown that actually there's a lot more accuracy with four than three. Is that not true?",
        "answer": "That's actually marginal. NewsGuard did a systematic study looking at different misinformation tropes, and they actually found that four was worse at promulgating those tropes than three and a half was.",

        "question": "Then why has four been seen to be so much better at, say, being able to pass an advanced placement exam or the bar exam or things like that?",
        "answer": "I suspect that actually has to do with what's in the training data, that it's not very general. So first of all, somebody found that in the law school exams, the percentile wasn't as high as initially reported. It was like 65 rather than 95, which is a world of difference. And second of all, I don't think that they measured contamination correctly. So if you read the paper carefully, they're basically saying was this question word for word in there? And the systems can do a bunch of synonymy. They can recognize things with slightly altered wording. If you wanted to do this as science rather than PR, you would want stricter measures about what actually counts as contamination in the data. I suspect that the reason it does as well as it does in a law school exam is because they probably bought 80 old LSATs or something like that, which no human is able to do. They made commercial agreements that are not disclosed. I suspect that a lot of the progress is like that. There is some real progress in some dimensions for four rather than, let's say, three and a half. But it's not at all clear that it's any better on the hallucination problem. This problem of inventing stuff that isn't there persists in four. It's not clear that it's actually better."

        "question": "Given what the money is presently being spent on, the exponential growth and capacity that we've experienced in the last couple of years, play it out 2, 3, 5 years, where do you think the biggest advances are going to be?",
        "answer": "There's no guarantee that all this money in is going to lead to an output. It might. There'll probably be some output. But I'll just as a cautionary tale remind you that driverless cars have been around for a long time. In 2016, I said even though these things look good right now, I'm not sure they're going to be commercialized anytime soon because there's an outlier problem. In the outlier problems, there's always some scenarios you haven't seen before, and the driverless cars continue to be plagued by this stuff seven years later. I gave an example then that Google had just maybe solved at that point a problem about recognizing piles of leaves on the road and I said there's going to be a huge number of these problems, we're never going to solve them, and we still haven't. So there was a Tesla that ran into a jet not that long ago because a jet wasn't in its training set. It didn't know what to do with it. It hasn't learned the abstract idea that driving involves not running into large objects. And so there's a particular large object that isn't in the training set, it doesn't know what to do. So what happened there is a hundred billion went into this. Everybody was sure there was going to be a ton of money to be made, and still, there hasn't been. The driverless car industry so far has just sucked in money and not actually made driverless cars that you can use in a reliable way. Take medicine. It's not clear that even GPT five is going to be a reliable source of medicine. Four is actually better than three, but is it reliable enough is an interesting question. Each year's driverless car is better than the last, but is it reliable enough? Not so far. And so whether you'll make that threshold in a domain where it's really safety critical is unclear. Already, four is great at writing boilerplate text. Five will be even better at writing boilerplate text. Erik Brynjolfsson is arguing that there'll be productivity improvements, and I think at least in some places like customer service where there's still some humans in the loop, we'll see even more of that. So there's definitely going to be things we get out of it, but there's also risks."

    "example": {
        "question": "What I am hearing pretty consistently, and I think it certainly aligns with what you're telling me today, is that humans in the loop remain essential for almost all of the uses of AI that we're really benefiting from.",
        "answer": "Yeah, that's true for large language models. You could argue that the routing systems, routing systems, that you use in your GPS, that just works. You don't need a human in the loop there. Same with a chess computer. You can just play the chess computer. You don't need a human there. Large language models are actually special in their unreliability. They're arguably the most versatile AI technique that's ever been developed, but they're also the least reliable AI technique that's ever gone mainstream. And so everything where we're using large language models, we do for now need humans in the loop."

    "example": {
        "question": "Before we close, I want to ask you just for a moment about the what do we do about this side, which is the governance side. We don't really have a regulatory environment yet, the government actors don't know a lot about the stuff that you know a lot about yet, maybe ever. The architecture's not there, the institutions aren't there. Give me just for a moment where you think the beginnings of effective governance or regulation would come from in this environment.",
        "answer": "First thing is I think every nation has to have its own AI agency or cabinet level position, something like that, in recognition of how fast things are moving and in recognition of the fact that you can't just do this with your left hand. You can't just say, all the existing agencies, \"Yeah, you can just do a little bit more and handle AI.\" There's so much going on. Somebody's job needs to be look at all of the moving parts and say, \"What are we doing well? What are we not doing well? What are the risks, the cyber crime, misinformation? How are we handling these kinds of things?\" So we need some centralization there. Not to eliminate existing agencies, which still have a big role to play, but to coordinate them and figure out what to do. We also, I think, need global AI governance. We don't really want to have, and the companies don't really want to have, different systems in every single country. So for example, it's very expensive to train these models. If you have 193 countries with 193 different regimes requiring so much damage to our climate and maybe updating them every month or whatever, that would be just a climate disaster. So we want some international coordination. And then another thing that I think is important for each nation, and maybe we do this globally, is I think we need to move to something like an FDA model where if you're going to do something that you deploy at wide scale, you have to make a safety case. So sure, you can do research in your own labs, Google doesn't have to tell us everything they're doing, OpenAI doesn't have to tell us everything they're doing. But if they're going to put something out for a hundred million users, we really want to make sure it's safe and ask what are the risks here? What are you doing about those risks? Right now the companies are doing those things internally, but we need to have external scientists who can say, \"Hey, wait a minute,\" and I'll give you an example. There's something called ChatGPT plugins, which has now given rise to something called AutoGPT, which can access your files and the internet and even other human beings. Any external cybersecurity expert would say, \"There's a lot of risk here.\" But the companies, OpenAI, went ahead and said, \"It's fine. We can do this.\" Whereas Apple says, \"We have to sandbox every application. We have to limit what its access is.\" So OpenAI has done something completely at odds with best practice that we know elsewhere in the software industry, and there's no constraint on that and could actually lead to pretty serious harm. There are cases like these where we really need some external advisory that can say, \"This isn't good enough.\" Sort of like peer review. You don't just publish a paper, you have people examine it. We need to do the same thing. You can't just put something out. And if you affect a hundred million users, you really affect everybody. So just as one example, these systems are going to affect people's political opinions. So everybody, even if they signed up or not, is going to be affected by what these systems do. We have no transparency, we don't know what data they're trained on, we don't know how they're going to influence the political process, and so that affects everybody. And so we should have some oversight of that."

My guess is that they don\u2019t, and if anything, reduce AI race dynamics.I will consider a simplified model that only takes into account the cost of training a model, not the cost to deploy it (which tends to be small relative to revenue anyway). Let f(x) map a training expense x to a \u201cvalue per day per customer\u201d of the trained model, under the assumption that the training makes efficient use of the cost. That is, a customer values using an AI model trained with x compute at $f(x) per day.I assume there are n identical customers here; of course, there are complexities where some customers value AI more than others, incentivizing price discrimination, but I\u2019m abstracting this consideration out. (In general, variation in how much customers value a product will tend to increase consumer surplus while reducing revenue, as it makes it harder to charge customers just under the maximum amount they\u2019re willing to pay.)I\u2019m also assuming there is only one company that trains closed models for profit. This assumption is flawed because there is competition between different companies that train closed models. However, perfect competition assumptions would tend to reduce the incentive to train models. Suppose two companies have closed models of equivalent expense x. They each want to charge slightly less than the minimum of f(x) and the competitor\u2019s price, per customer per day. If each competitor undercuts the other slightly, the cost will approach 0. See the Traveler\u2019s Dilemma for a comparison. The reasons why this doesn\u2019t happen have to do with considerations like differences in models\u2019 performance on different tasks, e.g. some models are better for programming than others. If models are sufficiently specialized (allowing this sort of niche-monopolization), each specialized type of model can be modeled independently as a monopoly. So I\u2019ll analyze the case of a closed model monopoly, noting that translation to the real world is more complex.Suppose the best open model has compute x and a company trains a closed model with compute y > x. Each customer will now spend up to f(y) - f(x) per day for the model; I\u2019ll assume the company charges f(y) - f(x) and the customers purchase this, noting that they could charge just below this amount to create a positive incentive for customers. So the company\u2019s revenue over m days is nm(f(y) - f(x)). Clearly, this is decreasing in x. So the better the open model is, the less expected revenue there is from training a closed model.But this is simply comparing doing nothing to training a model of a fixed cost y. So consider instead comparing expected revenue between two different model costs, y and z, both greater than x. The revenue from y is nm(f(y) - f(x)), and from z it is nm(f(z) - f(x)). The difference between the z revenue and the y revenue is nm(f(z) - f(y)). This is unaffected by x.This can model a case where the company has already trained a model of cost y and is considering upgrading to z. In this case, the open model doesn\u2019t affect the expected additional revenue from the upgrade.Things get more complex when we assume there will be a future improvement to the open model. Suppose that, for k days, the open model has training cost x, and for the remaining m-k days, it has training cost x\u2019 > x.Now suppose that the closed AI company has already trained a model of cost y, where x < y < x\u2019. They are considering upgrading to a model of cost z, where z > x\u2019.Suppose they do not upgrade. Then they get nk(f(y) - f(x)) revenue from the first k days and nothing thereafter.Suppose they do upgrade, immediately. Then they get nk(f(z) - f(x)) revenue from the first k days, and n(m-k)(f(z) - f(x\u2019)) from the remaining days.Clearly, increasing x\u2019 past y will result in less revenue for the upgrade in comparison to not upgrading. So the announcement of the upgrade of the open model to x\u2019 compute will reduce the incentive to race by training a closed model with z compute.So in this simplified analysis, release of better open models reduces the incentive to race, or does nothing. This is overall not surprising, as intellectual property laws are motivated by incentivizing production of intellectual property, and open content tends to reduce the value of intellectual property.There are a number of factors that could be taken into account in other analyses, including:Effects of open models on ease of training closed modelsSubstitution effects between different model niches (i.e. a model with an absolute advantage at mathematics may still be useful for writing essays)Effects of uncertainty over open model releasesDifferent customers valuing the AI differently, driving price discriminationNon-straightforward incentives such as prestige/recruitment from releasing modelsOligopoly dynamicsTime discountingChanges in customer demand over timeIt should go without saying that effects on race dynamics are not the only relevant effect of open model releases. Isolating and estimating different effects, however, will help in making an overall evaluation.I suggest that someone who still believes that open models increase race dynamics clarify what economic assumptions they are using and how they differ from this model."]

Normally people would consider this evidence of bad writing. But I actually think it\u2019s evidence of good writing, at least in this case. In Death Note, the game that characters are playing is obvious enough that suboptimal strategies are recognizable. The world of Death Note is, mostly, the real world with some additional rule-bound supernatural mechanics. Contrast this with most fiction, where the world works on unclear rules, and characters are playing unclear games. In that case it\u2019s harder to say that the characters are being stupid, because for the most part, they\u2019re not even wrong.Since Death Note has relatively clear game mechanics, it sheds some light on areas of life that have game interpretations, but which generally resist formalization.

I will define Kelly betting a certain class of discrete prediction markets, give a simple Kelly betting rule for these prediction markets, and show it equivalent to the original Kelly formula in a two-outcome case.A prediction market consists of a finite set of outcomes O, and a probability measure Q(O) on these outcomes. Participants may buy, for some outcome o, a contract that pays out $1 if o comes true, for a price of $Q(o). This assumes no transaction fees.Suppose you have m money. You are going to spend all your money on these contracts, with R being a probability measure over O, and R(o) being the portion of money you spend on each type of contract. Note that you can buy some of each contract as an equivalent to holding on to money (e.g. to \"hold on\" to $2, buy 2 copies of each contract o, costing $2 in total; these contracts combined will always pay out $2). This means it's fine to assume that spending all your money on contracts doesn't compromise optimality.If your subjective probabilities of the outcomes are defined by a probability measure P(O), what is the optimal R(O) that maximizes your log-money at the end of this round?Your money conditional on outcome o is mR(o)/Q(o), since you are spending mR(o) on contracts costing Q(o) each. Therefore your expected log-money is:\\(f(R) := \\sum_{o \\in O} P(o) \\log \\frac{m R(o)}{Q(o)} = \\sum_{o \\in O} P(o) (\\log m + \\log R(o) - \\log Q(o))\\)Note that the log m and log Q(o) terms do not depend on R. We can therefore ignore these terms when taking the partial derivatives with respect to each R(o):\\(\\frac{\\partial f(R)}{\\partial R(o)} = \\frac{\\partial (P(o) \\log R(o))}{\\partial R(o)} = \\frac{P(o)}{R(o)}\\)If any of these partial derivatives are greater than any other, then expected log-money can be increased by moving a small amount of money from the outcome with the lower partial derivative to the one with the higher partial derivative (since f is continuous). Therefore, at the maximum of f, these partial derivatives all equal some constant c, i.e., P(o)/R(o) = c for some c. (Formally proving this might require some additional work, using the fact that f is concave and R(o) has to be positive whenever P(o) is positive; I'll omit this for brevity.)Equivalently, R(o) = P(o) / c. But this must imply c = 1, since R and P are both probability measures; any other c value would result in R not summing to 1. This implies R = P. What this means is that the optimal Kelly betting strategy involves spending a P(o) portion of your money on contracts paying out conditional on each outcome o.Interestingly, this is entirely independent of Q. This can also be seen by noticing that Q only contributes to additive terms in f that do not depend on R, such that the gradient does not depend on Q.Is this equivalent to the original Kelly rule in a two-outcome case? This rule is given by:\\(f^* = p - \\frac{1-p}{b}\\)where f* is the optimal portion of your money to bet, p is the probability of a win, and b is the ratio between how much is gained on a win versus how much is lost on a loss (e.g. on a triple-or-nothing coin toss, b = 2, because twice as much is gained on a win than is lost on a loss).We can set O = {w, l} (w is win, l is loss) and determine Q as a function of b. Specifically, we set \\(Q(w) = \\frac{1}{b+1} \\)\\(Q(l) = 1 - \\frac{1}{b+1} = \\frac{b}{b+1}\\)These are the implied house odds for b. If you spend x money on contracts paying out conditional on w, these contracts pay out x(b+1), corresponding to a net gain of xb money, whereas if you lose you simply lose x money; this therefore adequately translates b to a prediction market.Our rule says to spend a P(w) = p portion of your money on w contracts, and a 1-p portion of your money on l contracts. Suppose your starting money is m. If you win, your ending money is \\(\\frac{pm}{1/(b+1)} = pm(b+1)\\)If you lose, your ending money is\\(\\frac{(1-p)m}{b/(b+1)} = \\frac{(1-p)m(b+1)}{b}\\)Your loss upon losing is therefore:\\(m - \\frac{(1-p)m(b+1)}{b} = m\\left(1 - \\frac{(1-p)(b+1)}{b}\\right) = m\\left(1 - \\frac{(1-p)b}{b} - \\frac{1-p}{b}\\right) \\)\\(= m\\left(1 - (1-p) - \\frac{1-p}{b}\\right) = m\\left(p - \\frac{1-p}{b}\\right) = mf^*\\)As expected, when you lose, you lose a f* portion of your money. This is how much the original Kelly betting rule would lose upon losing. Therefore, in the 2-outcome cases covered by Kelly betting, our rule would agree.Why might this simple formulation be useful? The R = P formulation has given me greater intuition for Kelly betting and some ideas for how to extend it to more complex prediction markets. I find the formula a lot more intuitive, and its derivation more obvious, compared to the original Kelly betting formula."]

How EM field topology can address the overlooked cousin to the binding problem for consciousness\u201d, by Andr\u00e9s G\u00f3mez-Emilsson. This article seeks to address two problems with theories of consciousness, using an electromagnetic theory:The binding problem asks how a unified first person perspective (1PP) can bind experiences across multiple physically distinct activities, whether billions of individual neurons firing or some other underlying phenomenon. To a first approximation, the boundary problem asks why we experience hard boundaries around those unified 1PPs and why the boundaries operate at their apparent spatiotemporal scale.The binding problem is fairly easy to understand the basics of: it\u2019s about how \u201cour consciousness somehow binds multiple discrete features into a single unified awareness.\u201d The boundary problem is elaborated on:At the same time, our consciousness does not \u201cbind\u201d features without limit\u2014what we experience varies over time and is thus always strictly a subset of what could be experienced. There is an edge to our awareness, a boundary around us that is generally felt to exist at the human-scale of experience, rather than at the cellular or societal level.To me this seems not to be a problem with my preferred functionalist-ish theories of consciousness. A single brain mainly processes information from itself, and processes information from outside through fairly limited channels such as sensory perception. Therefore, it is unsurprising that no one experiences everything, because no one knows everything.One could speculate about there being super-entities, such as corporations, that have consciousness spanning many humans. This is not a major challenge to functionalism. If McDonalds experiences things its employees do not experience, it does not follow that any McDonalds employee writing papers about consciousness would report experiencing whatever McDonalds knows.

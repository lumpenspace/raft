Even pointed me to a paper, allegedly offering proof. The paper turns out to be pretty great, doing exactly the right test, but it doesn\u2019t prove what its title alleges. More like the opposite.The paper alleges \u201cGPT Can Solve Mathematical Problems Without a Calculator.\u201d But it doesn\u2019t really show that, except in the sense that I can shoot free throws in the NBA, Sure, I can toss the ball in the air, and sometimes I might even sink a shot, the more so with practice; but I am probably going to miss a lot, too.  And 70% would be great for free throws; for multiplication it sucks. 47323 * 19223 = 909690029 and it shall always be; no partial credit for coming close.Here\u2019s what actually happened, in the paper in question: The authors trained their 2 billion parameter model, called MathGLM, on an enormous, 50 million record  custom \u201c dataset .. designed to encompass a wide spectrum of arithmetic operations, spanning from straightforward 1-atomic operation to more complex 9-atomic operations.\u201d The authors add that : By adopting this step-by-step strategy, MathGLM learns to handle both simple and intricate arithmetic expressions, which empowers it to accurately perform calculations even for operations involving multiplication of numbers greater than 8 digits, and those with decimals and fractions. Moreover, we incorporate the concept of curriculum learning to further augment the capabilities of MathGLM.\u201d My (innately-programmed) calculator by contrast has received no training at all. Let\u2019s compare, and start easy: 5 digit multiplication problems.The 2B model does better (85.16%) as expected than a smaller version, trained on MathGLM-500m (83.45), MathGLM-500, and crushes both ChatGPT (5.43%) and GPT (6.64%). Very impressive, relatively speaking. But then again any pocket calculator would score 100%. So there\u2019s still obviously room for improvement. What happens if we try bigger and bigger math problems, in which the training space is less densely covered? Fortunately, the authors tested exactly that, reporting results in their Table 7. The biggest, best model is MathGLM-2B; as a baseline that should have been included in the paper,I have taken the liberty of adding the expected results from a calculator on the right, in green.Notice anything? It\u2019s not just that the performance on MathGLM steadily declines as the problems gets bigger, with the discrepancy between it and a calculator steadily increasing, it\u2019s that the LLM based system is generalizing by similarity, doing better on cases that are in or near the training set, never, ever getting to a complete, abstract, reliable representation of what multiplication is.  A calculator, without the benefit of 2B parameters, would be at 100%, because it is programmed, at the factory, with an algorithm that actually computes multiplication. The LLM never induces such an algorithm. That, in a nutshell, is why we should never trust pure LLMs; even under carefully controlled circumstances with massive amounts of directly relevant data, they still never really get even the most basic linear functions. (In a recent series of posts on X, Daniel Litt has documented a wide variety of other math errors as well.) Some kind of hybrid may well work, but LLMs on their own remain stuck.\u00a7As a brief postscript, Steven Pinker and I were making nearly identical arguments about English past tense verbs in the early 1990s, suggesting that children learned some aspects of language (eg irregular verbs) in similarity-driven ways, but others (e.g. regular verbs) in a more abstract, similarity-independent way that was out of reach of the precursors to deep learning that were then popular. Thirty years later, the same Achilles\u2019 Heel remains. Gary Marcus feels really old whenever he has to write articles like this. He had really hoped to have said his last word about them in 2001, when he wrote The Algebraic Mind. When the field finally figures out how to learn algebraic abstractions from data, reliably, his work will finally be done.Subscribe"}
{"title": "Reports of the birth of AGI are greatly exaggerated", "link": "https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/reports-of-the-birth-of-agi-are-greatly", "date": "2023-10-18T17:19:07.929Z", "content": "Marvin Minsky apparently thought, back in the 1960s, that computer vision was a problem that could be solved in a summer. (Spoiler alert, in 2023 the problem is still far from solved). What\u2019s new, though, are rumors that AGI has been solved. Sam Altman announced in late September, perhaps in jest, that \u201cAGI has been achieved internally\u201d, only to walk it back a few hours later. Last week, Blaise Ag\u00fcera y Arcas, vice president and fellow at Google Research, and Peter Norvig, formerly Director of Research at Google, and now at Stanford, argued in all seriousness that \u201cArtificial General Intelligence Is Already Here\u201d\u2014 in what can only be described as an epic act of goal-post shifting.The article begins with this bold claim: \u201cToday\u2019s frontier models perform competently even on novel tasks they were not trained for, crossing a threshold that previous generations of AI and supervised deep learning systems never managed. Decades from now, they will be recognized as the first true examples of AGI, just as the 1945 ENIAC is now recognized as the first true general-purpose electronic computer.\u201d\u00a0Ag\u00fcera y Arcas and Norvig describe the ways in which large language models (LLMs) can carry out tasks for which they were not specifically trained; they claim that this ability is key to being an AGI; and they argue that therefore the kernel of AGI has been achieved. They conclude with a long, condescending discussion of the various reasons that some pitifully confused people are \u201creluctan[t] to acknowledge [that] \u00a0AGI has already arrived.\u201dCount us among the confused; we really, really don\u2019t know what Ag\u00fcera y Arcas and Norvig are talking about.\u00a7To begin with, by the classical criteria for AGI [Artificial General Intelligence], LLM\u2019s hardly qualify. One of us wrote about those criteria last year, in this Substack, \u00a0in preparation for a proposed bet with Elon Musk, consulting with two of the people who coined the term AGI, Ben Goertzel and Shane Legg, and came up with this.If we are going to bet, we should make some ground rules. The term AGI is pretty vague, and that\u2019s not good for either of us. As I offered on Twitter the other day: I take AGI to be \u201ca shorthand for any intelligence ... that is flexible and general, with resourcefulness and reliability comparable to (or beyond) human intelligence\u201d.Current machines can\u2019t do this, especially not the reliability part. They can\u2019t count, do five digit multiplication,\u00a0 reliably generalize kinship relations, or even reliably follow the rules of chess, and so on\u2014despite the fact that each of these activities is presumably well explained, explicitly, in the training set, They also can\u2019t, for example, obey the dictum \u201cdon\u2019t make stuff up\u201d, when they write a biography or a new story, and we have yet to see them drive cars as well as the average human adult.DeepMind co-founder Shane Legg is generally more optimistic about AI than we are, but even he couldn\u2019t quite see what his Google colleagues Aguera y Arcas and Norvig are on about; when we asked him on X whether he bought their argument, he replied as diplomatically as he could, and optimistically, but with a clear affirmation of what we said: AyA&N had lowered the bar :They use a lower bar for AGI than I do, and so they get a different answer.\u00a0 My bar for AGI is a machine that can do the cognitive tasks that people can typically do.\u00a0 We're not there yet, but we're much closer to this than we were a few years ago.Melanie Mitchell was also a bit diplomatic, but at least as miffed as we were by the condescension:They made some good points, but also made some dubious statements.\u00a0 Also, I think the undercurrent of dismissal of \"skeptics\" is not helpful.\u00a0 All scientists should be skeptics -- that's part of the job.\u00a7The problem with the paper though isn\u2019t just its hostility towards critics, or the way in which it lowers the bar, it\u2019s that its key arguments don\u2019t go through.One key claim (written in bold pullout text) that made our jaw drop was that \u201cFrontier language models can perform competently at pretty much any information task that can be done by humans, can be posed and answered using natural language, and has quantifiable performance.\u201d That\u2019s just obviously not so. There are many purely language-based tasks that humans can do \u2014 question answering, writing factual prose, summarizing, examining the truth of a claim, cross-examining a hostile witness in court, reading and understanding a full-length book \u2014 that existing AI systems cannot perform \u201ccompetently\u201d. The first author\u2019s nine-year-old can do five digit multiplication better than an LLM. We love Noema, but their fact checker was asleep at the switch. (What Ag\u00fcera y Arcas and Norvig might really mean, perhaps, is that LLMs do well on a lot of benchmarks, but then again since we don\u2019t know eg how many law school exams GPT-4 was trained on, it\u2019s hard to even know what to say about these benchmarks. The fact that making benchmarks is hard doesn\u2019t mean LLMs have achieved AGI).Meanwhile, the boldfaced (written in bold pullout text) claim that \u201cThe most important parts of AGI have already been achieved by the current generation of advanced AI large language models\u201d is logically flawed. Until we get to the finish line, we can\u2019t know the route. \u00a0Maybe what\u2019s required already exists, but more likely, we are still at least a few paradigm shifts away . To take one example, true AGI might revolve around planning with respect to detailed world models that are maintained over time; as Subbarao Kambhampati has shown, LLMs are weak at planning; as hallucinations show, they are also weak at the maintenance of world models, strongly suggesting some key ingredients have not yet been invented. It\u2019s certainly plausible that some of the prerequisites of AGI may have been achieved, but considerable overreach to presume that all of \u201cthe most important ones\u201d have already been invented.\u00a7The fact that LLMs trained on the task of next-token prediction can also do a pretty good job at a variety of natural language tasks, and, very recently, a considerably less good job of tasks that combine text with images, as emphasized by Ag\u00fcera y Arcas and Norvig is certainly interesting, but it doesn\u2019t justify the claim that they constitute \u201cgeneral intelligence\u201d. \u00a0It is common in the history of technology (as well as biological evolution) that a mechanism developed for one purpose turns out to be useful for another. GPUs were developed for video games and other graphics applications, not for training deep learning systems or mining crypto-currency. That doesn\u2019t make GPU\u2019s AGI. (Though they may get used in the service of AGI when it comes).The World Wide Web was developed for sharing scientific papers, not for online commerce or for inducing people to make available enormous quantities of digital data that can be used to train ML-based AI systems. That generality doesn\u2019t make the web AGI.\u00a7Just one more thing to keep things real. It\u2019s worth noting that for many different AI tasks --- robotics, image interpretation, planning, game playing, scientific applications, many forms of reasoning --- state of the art AI currently makes little to no use of the transformer architecture that underpins LLMs. \u00a0If they really were AGI,  presumably  everybody would use them, for everything. But in many practical problems, working practitioners don\u2019t; they use a wide range of other methods, often far more tractable, far more reliable, and far more efficient. Transformers and generative AI are getting a lot of attention, and have considerable utility, but they are nothing like the all purpose tools some people seems to imagine them to be. \u00a0In AI, no single technique is likely to be a silver bullet, now or ever.Here\u2019s where we actually are, so much more more boring, and so much more real: \u00a0Current models trained on next-token prediction have remarkable abilities and remarkable weaknesses. The scope of those abilities and weaknesses of the current systems is not well understood. There are some applications where the current systems are reliable enough to be practically useful, though not nearly as many as is often claimed.\u00a0 No doubt the next generation of systems will have greater abilities and more extensive applications and will somewhat mitigate the weaknesses. What is to come is even more poorly understood than the present. But there is zero justification for claiming that the current technology has achieved general intelligence.ShareGary Marcus used to get flak for saying that some people were trying to build AGI. Now, perhaps, he will get flak for saying that we haven\u2019t yet achieved it.Ernie Davis is a Professor of Computer Science at New York University.Subscribe"}

It\u2019s not just that consumers are hyped to get it, or that a whole bunch of business are planning to build companies around it; foreign policy is being built around it. Senators and military strategists have worried about would happen if China got GPT-5 before we did; the chip war, which just escalated further, might be built on such concerns. Still others sought a moratorium specifically for models of GPT-5\u2019s anticipated size. The upcoming Bletchley Park summit seems to be built on a simlar premise. Others, meanwhile, have imagined that GPT-5 might eradicate, or at least greatly eliminate, the many concerns people rightly have with current models, such as their unreliability, their tendency towards bias, and their propensity to confabulate authoritative nonsense. . But it\u2019s never been clear to me that simply building a bigger model which would actually solve any of those problems.Today, The Information broke the news that another OpenAI project, Arrakis, designed to make smaller, more efficient models, went bust, cancelled by the top brass after it didn\u2019t meet expectations.For months, something that Sam Altman said while sitting next to me in May at the US Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on AI Oversight has been reverberating back and forth  across my brain: \u201cWe are not currently training what will be GPT-5. We don\u2019t have plans to do it in the next six months.\u201dWhy not? Since pretty much all of us assumed that GPT-4 would be followed by GPT-5, often imagined to be significantly more powerful, as quickly as possible, that pair of Sam\u2019s sentences came as a surprise. There are various theories one could have. For example, OpenAI might not have had enough cash on hand to train these models (they are notoriously expensive to train). But OpenAI is about as flush with cash as almost any startup has ever been.  For a company that had just raised $10 billion, even a $500 million training run wouldn\u2019t be out of the question.Another theory is that OpenAI realized how expensive it would be either to train the model or to run it, and wasn\u2019t sure they could make a profit given those costs. That still seems viable. Still a third theory, my own, is that by the time of Altman\u2019s remarks in May, OpenAI had already run some tests as proof of concept, and didn\u2019t like what they saw. They might have decided that GPT-5, if it was simply a bigger version of GPT-4, would not meet expectations, and that it wasn\u2019t worth spending the hundreds of millions of dollars required, if the outcome would only turn out to be disappointing, or even embarrassing.The Information\u2019s scoop is a reminder that all men (and women), and all companies, are mortal. Few have risen as quickly, but there\u2019s no guarantee that OpenAI can maintain their stratospheric trajectory. If Yann LeCun and I are correct, AI will need genuinely new paradigms to get to the next level in AI, and OpenAI may be no closer to that than anyone else.\u00a7If GPT-5 did fail to please, or even if it were just deferred indefinitely (like so many promises that have been about driverless cars), it could have a rapid, deflationary effect on sky-high valuations.People might even start to realize that building truly reliable, trustworthy AI is actually really, really hard.Gary Marcus has seen neural networks rise and fall, and rise, and wonders what\u2019s next.Marcus on AI is a reader-supported publication.

Nuclear power is mentioned; the threat of nuclear war is never mentioned. Climate change is not.In an essay that declares that \"we believe in .. liberating people to make their own choices\", everyone who makes different choices, economic, social, scientific, or otherwise, is either denigrated or ignored.In an essay that declares that \"we believe in ...\u00a0 testing ideas empirically\", not one empirical study is cited.In the annals of argument, Andreesen's one-side recital of facts is historic. (Bertrand Russell, whom he cites as an ally, would hardly be pleased to be included, either on the grounds of logic or politics).\u00a7I am a techno-optimist, too, a Founder of two AI companies, someone who has worked on AI since childhood, and who spends every waking moment trying to think about how to achieve a positive outcome. But being long-term optimistic about technology doesn't mean you have to ignore the short-term (or long-term) risks of technology.It means working to recognize the risks, and working to address them, so that we can reach the positive outcomes that are promised, not casting those who recognize those risks as the enemy. It's mean *working* for a positive future, not just declaring that one is inevitable and hoping for the best.Gary Marcus is a techno-optimist, but not an Andreesen.https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&mkt_tok=MzgyLUpaQi03OTgAAAGO2BVrjWE_tL3o4OlMtNEihY3jAsMBKQ4k34IBBOtwaPtxN2JReP5PF-FUnXl8mwlkfnNJg-8x7ffoRf40GaU9DFNpBV-TDhDwlD_6fRgT6wMarcus on AI is a reader-supported publication.

In those heady days, a lot of people were blown by DALL-E 2, and some thought it was tantamount to AGI. I wasn\u2019t convinced. I pointed out, for example, that DALL-E had troubles with noncanonical cases like horse rides astronaut, even as it excelled at more canonical cases like astronaut rides horse.  A central passage in what I wrote then was this success there is not because the network knows how to extract meanings from individual words (\u201castronaut\u201d, \u201criding\u201d and so forth) or to combine them into semantic meanings based on their syntax (which is what linguist compositionality is all about), but rather that the network does something more holistic and approximate, a bit like keyword matching and a lot less like deep language understanding. What one really needs, and no one yet knows how to build, is a system that can derive semantics of wholes from their parts as a function of their syntax.About 18 months have passed; although there are certainly improvements (the images are vastly better), owing presumably in large part to a larger training set, the fundamental approach (mapping words to images, rather than constructing intermediate models of the world and how language and images relate to those models) remains the same, and so the core issue remains. And sometimes it comes out flagrant, even horrrible ways:\u00a7The problem here is not that DALL-E 3 is not trying to be racist. It\u2019s that it can\u2019t separate the world from the statistics of its dataset. DALL-E does not have a cognitive construct of a doctor or a patient or a human being or an occupation or medicine or race or egalitarianism or equal opportunity or any of that. If there happens not to be a lot of black doctors with white patients in the dataset, the system is SOL. \u00a7The proof? This time it\u2019s not in the pudding; it\u2019s in the watch. A couple days ago, someone discovered that the new multimodal ChatGPT had  trouble telling time:NYU Computer Scientist Mengye Ren explained what was going on. Guess what? It\u2019s the same issue of canonical versus noncanonical statistics, all over again.In other words, the systems are just blindly following the data, which, as Ren pointed out,  typically look like this1:\u00a7Blind fealty to the statistics of arbitrary data is not AGI. It\u2019s a hack. And not one that we should want. \u00a7As I wrote on Twitter a couple years ago, we need to \u201cinvent then a new breed of AI systems that mix an awareness of the past with values that represent the future that we aspire to. Our focus should be on figuring on how to build AI that can represent and reason about *values*,  rather than simply perpetuating past data\u201d.

{"title": "What was 60 Minutes thinking, in that interview with Geoff Hinton?", "link": "https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/what-was-60-minutes-thinking-in-that", "date": "2023-10-10T09:54:39.765Z", "content": "60 Minutes is known for their investigative journalism, and bless them for allowing me to call the outputs of generative AI \u201cauthoritative bullshit\u201d on network television.But not every interview they do hits the mark. The interview they just with Geoff Hinton has some positives, but there are way too many softballs, and there was essentially zero effort to press him on any of his alleged facts. Even in its title (which I call out in the postscript), CBS gave Hinton more credit than he deserves .I can\u2019t imagine a political interview this soft and weakly researched, with nary a thought as to what the alternative perspective might make of the interviewee. But, ok that happens. My jaw literally dropped about halfway through\u2014an astonishing editorial lapse that I call out below. The good news is that the gaffe is actually very much a teachable moment. Misleading advertising (see postscript) for an interview that seems not to have been well-researched \u00a7One last preliminary. As a literary device, I have written the below as a three way conversation that never quite happened, inspired by an email this morning from my friend Harry Shearer, who sent me an email, with the subject header 60 Minutes, \u201cYour thoughts on Hinton Sunday night? Want to rebut?\u201dDon\u2019t mind if I do!\u00a0 Below I annotate the transcript of the interview, tongue slightly in cheek, as if I were in the room. Every word that they, Hinton and Pelley, say is from the official CBS transcript; only my words are added. You will get to the CBS howler soon enough.As you will see, Hinton and I disagree on many points \u2013 but also agree on some others of profound importance.\u00a0 And that\u2019s worth noting, too. The fact that the interview is not what it should have been doesn\u2019t take away from the bravery in Hinton\u2019s speaking out about some legitimate concerns. If I am correct, he is wrong about some of the science, but right about what\u2019s at stake.\u00a7Scott Pelley: Does humanity know what it's doing?Geoffrey Hinton: No.Gary Marcus: I tend to agree. When it comes to AI in particular, we are getting way ahead of our skis, rushing forward a technology we don\u2019t fully understand. For all the differences we have had over the years, I salute you for speaking out.Geoffrey Hinton: I think we're moving into a period when for the first time ever we may have things more intelligent than us. \u00a0Scott Pelley: You believe they can understand?Geoffrey Hinton: Yes.Scott Pelley: You believe they are intelligent?Geoffrey Hinton: Yes.Gary Marcus: As it happens I sharply disagree with all three of the points Geoff just made. To be sure, it\u2019s all partly definitional. But I don\u2019t we are all that close to machines that are more intelligent than us, I don\u2019t think they really understand the things that they say, and I don\u2019t think they are intelligent in the sense of being able to adaptively and flexibly reason about things they haven\u2019t encountered before, in a reliable way. What Geoff has left out is any reference to all of the colossally stupid and ungrounded things generative AI systems do routinely, like fabricating the other night that Liz Cheney had replaced Kevin McCarthy as Speaker, by 220-215 vote that never happened, or learning that Tom Cruise\u2019s is the son of\u00a0 Mary Pfeiffer and yet not being able to infer that Mary Pfeiffer is Tom Cruise\u2019s mother, or claiming that two pounds of feathers way less than one pound of bricks. Geoff himself wrote a classic paper about trying to get neural networks to infer family relationships, almost forty years ago; it\u2019s embarrassing to see these systems still struggle on such basic problems. Since they can\u2019t reliably solve them, I don\u2019t think we should attribute \u201cunderstanding\u201d to them, at least not in any remotely deep sense of the word understanding. Emily Bender and Timnit Gebru have called these systems \u201cstochastic parrots\u201d, which in my view is a little unkind\u2014to parrots\u2013 but also vividly captures something real: a lot of what we are seeing now is a kind of unreliable mimicry. I really wish you could have addressed both the question of mimicry and of reliability. (Maybe next time?) I don\u2019t see how you can call an agent with such a loose grip on reality all that intelligent, nor how you can simply ignore the role of mimicry in all this.[Author\u2019s note: Pelley could and should pushed much harder on these issues, which by now are well-known.]\u00a7Scott Pelley: [Turning to Geoff] You believe these systems have experiences of their own and can make decisions based on those experiences?Geoffrey Hinton: In the same sense as people do, yes.Gary Marcus: You can\u2019t really mean this, do you? Do you think that large language models feel pain or joy? When Google\u2019s large language model LaMDA said that it enjoyed \u201cspending time  friends and family\u201d, those were just empty words. It didn\u2019t actually have friends or family that it spent time with. It just mimicked words that humans have said in similar contexts, without ever having experienced the same thing.\u00a0 Large language models may have experiences in some sense, but it is a bridge too far  to say that those experiences are the \u201csame\u201d as those of people.\u00a7Scott Pelley: Are they conscious?Geoffrey Hinton: I think they probably don't have much self-awareness at present. So, in that sense, I don't think they're conscious.Gary Marcus: But wait a minute, you just said they have experiences literally \u201cin the same sense as people\u201d, and now you don\u2019t think they are conscious? How can the experience be in the same sense as people, if they are not conscious. Of course, I don\u2019t think these machines are conscious, either.\u00a0 But you do seem to have contradicted yourself.Scott Pelley: Will they have self-awareness, consciousness?Geoffrey Hinton: Oh, yes.Gary Marcus: What makes you sure? How you are defining consciousness? When you say \u201cthey\u201d do you mean that the same kinds of systems as we are building now will somehow achieve consciousness? Or that you imagine that other kinds of AI, perhaps not yet discovered might? It would be great if you could clarify what you mean by this.[Hinton doesn\u2019t seem to hear my questions, and does not respond]Scott Pelley: Yes?Geoffrey Hinton: Oh, yes. I think they will, in time.\u00a0Gary Marcus: How much time? What kinds of systems?[Again no answers]\u00a7Scott Pelley: And so human beings will be the second most intelligent beings on the planet?Geoffrey Hinton: Yeah.[interlude by Scott Pelley] Geoffrey Hinton told us the artificial intelligence he set in motion was an accident born of a failure. In the 1970s, at the University of Edinburgh, he dreamed of simulating a neural network on a computer\u2014 simply as a tool for what he was really studying--the human brain. But, back then, almost no one thought software could mimic the brain.\u00a0 His Ph.D. advisor told him to drop it before it ruined his career. Hinton says he failed to figure out the human mind. But the long pursuit led to an artificial version. \u00a0Geoffrey Hinton: It took much, much longer than I expected. It took, like, 50 years before it worked well, but in the end, it did work well.Gary Marcus: \u201cWork well\u201d remains a tendentious claim; they still cannot be trusted, make random mistakes, have no basis in factuality. They approximate intelligence, when what they need to say resembles something in a database of text written by humans, but the still have enough problems we  don\u2019t yet have driverless cars we can trust, and many companies are looking at generative AI saying, \u201cnice try, but it\u2019s not sound enough yet\u201d. I think it\u2019s fair to say that generative AI works better than most people expected. But to simply ignore their serious issues in reliability is one-sided, and misrepresents reality.\u00a7Scott Pelley [with unflinching admiration]: At what point did you realize that you were right about neural networks and most everyone else was wrong?Geoffrey Hinton: I always thought I was right.Gary Marcus: Actually \u2026 a  lot of us still think you are declaring victory prematurely. It\u2019s not just me either. For example, you should really check out Macarthur Award winner Yejin Choi\u2019s recent TED talk  She concludes that we still have a long way to go, saying for example that \u201cSo my position is that giving true \u2026 common sense to AI, is still moonshot\u201d. I do wish this interview could have at least acknowledged that there is another side to the argument. [More narration from Pelley In 2019, Hinton and collaborators, Yann Lecun,\u2026Yoshua Bengio, won the Turing Award-- the Nobel Prize of computing. To understand how their work on artificial neural networks helped machines learn to learn, let us take you to a game. ]This is Google's AI lab in London, which we first showed you this past April. Geoffrey Hinton wasn't involved in this soccer project, but these robots are a great example of machine learning. The thing to understand is that the robots were not programmed to play soccer. They were told to score. They had to learn how on their own.]In general, here's how AI does it. Hinton and his collaborators created software in layers, with each layer handling part of the problem. That's the so-called neural network.\u00a0 But this is the\u00a0key: when, for example, the robot scores, a message is sent back down through all of the layers that says, \"that pathway was right.\"\u00a0Likewise, when an answer is wrong, that message goes down through the network. So, correct connections get stronger. Wrong connections get weaker. And by trial and error, the machine teaches itself.\u00a7Scott Pelley: You think these AI systems are better at learning than the human mind.Geoffrey Hinton: I think they may be, yes. And at present, they're quite a lot smaller. So even the biggest chatbots only have about a trillion connections in them.\u00a0 The human brain has about 100 trillion. And yet, in the trillion connections in a chatbot, it knows far more than you do in your hundred trillion connections, which suggests it's got a much better way of getting knowledge into those connections.--a much better way of getting knowledge that isn't fully understood.Gary Marcus: The connections in chatbots are very different from the connections in the brain; it\u2019s a mistake to compare them directly in this way. (For example, in human brains the type of neuron being connected matters, and there are more than a thousand different types of neurons in the brain, but not of that is captured by the current batch of chatbots.) And we can\u2019t really compare human knowledge and the stuff chatbots are doing. I know for example that Elon Musk is still alive, but sometimes\u00a0 a chatbot will say that he died in a car crash. I know that if Tom Cruise\u2019s mother is Mary Pfeiffer, Tom Cruise has to be Mary\u2019s son.  I know that I don\u2019t have a pet chicken named Henrietta, but a chatbot said last week with perfect confidence (and no sources) that I did. As they sometimes say in the military \u201cfrequently wrong, never in doubt.\u201d  There\u2019s some information in there, but whatever\u2019s there is often both patchy and problematic.\u00a7Geoffrey Hinton: We have a very good idea of sort of roughly what it's doing. But as soon as it gets really complicated, we don't actually know what's going on any more than we know what's going on in your brain.Scott Pelley: What do you mean we don't know exactly how it works? It was designed by people.Geoffrey Hinton: No, it wasn't. What we did was we designed the learning algorithm. Gary Marcus: Agreed.Geoffrey Hinton: That's a bit like designing the principle of evolution. But when this learning algorithm then interacts with data, it produces complicated neural networks that are good at doing things. But we don't really understand exactly how they do those things.Gary Marcus: Fully agree with Geoff here. I would only add that this is a serious problem, for many reasons. It makes current AI hard to debug (nobody knows for example how to ground them in facts), and it makes them difficult predict, which means, unlike calculators or spreadsheets, we don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going to happen when we ask them a question. This makes engineering with them exceptionally hard, and it\u2019s one reason why some companies have been cautious about using these systems despite their strong pointers.Scott Pelley: What are the implications of these systems autonomously writing their own computer code and executing their own computer code?Geoffrey Hinton: That's a serious worry, right? So, one of the ways in which these systems might escape control is by writing their own computer code to modify themselves. And that's something we need to seriously worry about.Gary Marcus: Agree again. But this problem is twofold; they might escape control because they are smarter than us, but also simply because they don\u2019t really know what it is they are doing. Just like we can\u2019t guarantee that they won\u2019t make stuff up, we don\u2019t know how to guarantee that they won\u2019t write flawed code. We are giving way too much authority to machines that we can\u2019t control. Put me, too, down in the column of people who are seriously worried about letting poorly understood neural networks write computer code.Scott Pelley: What do you say to someone who might argue, \"If the systems become malevolent, just turn them off\"?Geoffrey Hinton:\u00a0 They will be able to manipulate people, right? And these will be very good at convincing people 'cause they'll have learned from all the novels that were ever written, all the books by Machiavelli, all the political connivances, they'll know all that stuff. They'll know how to do it.Gary: Geoff is totally right about this. Of course current systems don\u2019t really understand Machiavelli, but they don\u2019t have to, if they parrot the right bits of text. We\u2019ve already seen cases where machines have manipulated people, and we will see a lot more as time goes by; this is one of the reasons laws should be written to make machines disclose the fact that they are machines.\u00a7[Omitted is a discussion of Hinton\u2019s illustrious family background]\u00a7Scott Pelley: Confounding, absolutely confounding.We asked Bard to write a story from six words.Scott Pelley: For sale. Baby shoes. Never worn.Scott Pelley: Holy Cow! The shoes were a gift from my wife, but we never had a baby\u2026Bard created a deeply human tale of a man whose wife could not conceive and a stranger, who accepted the shoes to heal the pain after her miscarriage.\u00a0Scott Pelley: I am rarely speechless. I don't know what to make of this.\u00a0Gary Marcus: Holy cow indeed. But it is I who is speechless. Baby shoes never worn is a very old story, sometimes attributed to Hemingway, with about 21 million Google hits, and an entire wikipedia entry, as perhaps the best known example of very short fiction. I am floored that you didn\u2019t bother to check if the story was original. Your best example of a spectacular machine invention is in fact a perfect example of the kind of parroting and theft of intellectual property that is characteristic of large language models.\u00a7Chatbots are said to be language models that just predict the next most likely word based on probability.\u00a0Geoffrey Hinton: You'll hear people saying things like, \"They're just doing auto-complete. They're just trying to predict the next word. And they're just using statistics.\u201dGary: I am in fact one of those people.Geoffrey Hinton:\u00a0 Well, it's true they're just trying to predict the next word. But if you think about it, to predict the next word you have to understand the sentences.\\Gary: False. If you have a large enough database, you can do a half decent job just by looking up the most similar sentence in the database, and saying what was said in that context. Large language models are trained, as far as we know, on pretty much the entire internet. That gives them enormous databases to train on, and means that the feat of prediction doesn\u2019t necessarily tell us anything about understanding. If I had a big enough database of Ancient Greek, I could do the same, but that I wouldn\u2019t mean I understand Greek.\u00a0 To be fair, large language models aren\u2019t just looking things up, but the idea that a good prediction of next word necessarily implies understanding is fallacious.Geoffrey Hinton: \u00a0 So, the idea they're just predicting the next word so they're not intelligent is crazy.Gary Marcus: Let\u2019s try this again: you can predict a next word to reasonable degree without being intelligent, if you have enough data.\u00a0 But the reason I don\u2019t think the systems are intelligent isn\u2019t just because these systems are next word predictors (which they are) but also because, for example, they are utterly incapable of fact checking what they say, even against their own databases, and because in careful tests over and over they make silly errors over and over again.Geoff Hinton: You have to be really intelligent to predict the next word really accurately.Gary Marcus: They aren\u2019t always accurate. We both know that. 2 kilograms of feathers don\u2019t weigh less one kilogram of bricks. They just don\u2019t.\u00a7In the next bit, Pelley and Hinton show an example in which ChatGPT succeeds at reasoning, but they never consider any of those in which it fails\u2014thereby inadvertently illustrating a very human failure, confirmation bias.To prove it, Hinton showed us a test he devised for ChatGPT4, the chatbot from a company called OpenAI. It was sort of reassuring to see a Turing Award winner mistype and blame the computer.Geoffrey Hinton: Oh, damn this thing! We're going to go back and start again.Scott Pelley: That's OKHinton's test was a riddle about house painting. An answer would demand reasoning and planning. This is what he typed into ChatGPT4.Geoffrey Hinton: \"The rooms in my house are painted white or blue or yellow. And yellow paint fades to white within a year. In two years' time, I'd like all the rooms to be white. What should I do?\"\u00a0The answer began in one second, GPT4 advised \"the rooms painted in blue\" \"need to be repainted.\" \"The rooms painted in yellow\" \"don't need to [be] repaint[ed]\" because they would fade to white before the deadline.\u00a0 And... \u00a0Geoffrey Hinton: Oh! I didn't even think of that!It warned, \"if you paint the yellow rooms white\" there's a risk the color might be off when the yellow fades. \u00a0Besides, it advised, \"you'd be wasting resources\" painting rooms that were going to fade to white anyway.Scott Pelley: You believe that ChatGPT4 understands?\u00a0Geoffrey Hinton: I believe it definitely understands, yes. \u00a0Gary Marcus: Hey guys, what about the many cases that Yejin Choi and Ernie Davis and Melanie Mitchell and Subbarao Kambhampati and many others have shown where these systems failed? Are you ever going to mention them?[More Silence]\u00a7Scott Pelley: And in five years' time?Geoffrey Hinton: I think in five years' time it may well be able to reason better than us\u00a0Gary Marcus: In 2016 you said that it was \u201cquite obvious that we should stop training radiologists\u201d because deep learning was getting so good. You know how many radiologists have been replaced by machines seven years later? Zero.Geoffrey Hinton: So an obvious area where there's huge benefits is health care. AI is already comparable with radiologists at understanding what's going on in medical images.Gary Marcus: Scott, this is your chance! C\u2019mon, hold him to account! [Silence]. Well, ok, so far we still get best results by combining machine vision with human understanding. I don\u2019t really think machines get the big picture that human radiologists do; they are better on vision than understanding the case files and notes and so on.Geoff Hinton: It's gonna be very good at designing drugs. Gary Marcus: Another promise, no proof yet.Geoff Hinton: It already is designing drugs. So that's an area where it's almost entirely gonna do good. I like that area.Gary Marcus: I like that area too, but as far as I know from AI we still just have what we call candidate drugs, nothing yet proven to work. So, some caution is advised, though I agree with Geoff that eventually\u00a0AI will have a big impact on drug design. Perhaps with current techniques, perhaps not; we will have to see.\u00a7Scott Pelley: The risks are what?Geoffrey Hinton: Well, the risks are having a whole class of people who are unemployed and not valued much because what they-- what they used to do is now done by machines.Narration: Other immediate risks [Hinton] worries about include fake news, unintended bias in employment and policing and autonomous battlefield robots.Gary Marcus: 100% agree, and I would add cybercrime. And emphasize that wholesale, automated fake news will be used both to manipulate markets and elections, and might undermine democracy.Scott Pelley: What is a path forward that ensures safety?Geoffrey Hinton: I don't know. I-- I can't see a path that guarantees safety.Gary Marcus: I can\u2019t either; there\u2019s a lot we can do to help, but nothing I can see either to absolutely guarantee safety. Rushing ahead is creating risk.Geoffrey Hinton:\u00a0 We're entering a period of great uncertainty where we're dealing with things we've never dealt with before. And normally, the first time you deal with something totally novel, you get it wrong. And we can't afford to get it wrong with these things.\u00a0Gary Marcus: Absolutely, 100% agree.Scott Pelley: Can't afford to get it wrong, why?Geoffrey Hinton: Well, because they might take over.Scott Pelley: Take over from humanity?Geoffrey Hinton: Yes. That's a possibility.Scott Pelley: Why would they want to?Geoffrey Hinton: I'm not saying it will happen. If we could stop them ever wanting to, that would be great. But it's not clear we can stop them ever wanting to.Gary Marcus: I am much more worried about bad actors deliberately misusing AI, than machines deliberately wanting to take over. But Geoff\u2019s right that we can\u2019t fully rule it out either. And that\u2019s really sobering.\u00a7[narration] Geoffrey Hinton told us he has no regrets because of AI's potential for good. But he says now is the moment to run experiments to understand AI, for governments to impose regulations and for a world treaty to ban the use of military robots. He reminded us of Robert Oppenheimer who after inventing the atomic bomb, campaigned against the hydrogen bomb--a man who changed the world and found the world beyond his control.\u00a0Geoffrey Hinton: It may be we look back and see this as a kind of turning point when humanity had to make the decision about whether to develop these things further and what to do to protect themselves if they did. I don't know. I think my main message is there's enormous uncertainty about what's gonna happen next. These things do understand. And because they understand, we need to think hard about what's going to happen next. And we just don't know.Gary Marcus: Fully agreed with most\u2014but not quite all\u2014of that. Geoff and I can disagree all day (as we have for the last thirty years) about how smart current AI is, and what if anything they understand, but we are in complete agreement that we are at a turning point with enormous uncertainty, and that we need to make the right choices now.ShareGary Marcus is the co-author of Rebooting AI, the founder of two AI companies, the host of the podcast Humans versus Machines, and the author of this newsletter, Marcus on AI.

{"title": "Muddles about Models", "link": "https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/muddles-about-models", "date": "2023-10-05T15:31:19.625Z", "content": "In a new paper that is lighting X on fire (1.6 million views and counting), called Language Models Represent Space and Time, Wes Gurnee and Max Tegmark argue that \u201cmodern LLMs acquire structured knowledge about fundamental dimensions such as space and time, supporting the view that they learn not merely superficial statistics, but literal world models\u201d, based on some analyses of the alleged capacity of LLMs to understand geography.Although I have little doubt in the results, I sharply disagree with their argument. Of course as Fei Fei Li correctly pointed out on X, it all depends on what you mean by a \u201cmodel\u201d, but here\u2019s the crux, same as it ever was: correlations aren\u2019t causal, semantic models. Finding that some stuff correlates with space or time doesn\u2019t mean that stuff genuinely represents space or time. No human worth their salt would think there are dozens of cities thousands of miles off East Coast, throughout the Atlantic Ocean.  Correlating where cities are with what\u2019s said about them is no substitute for a map. It\u2019s also not even remotely new. Although Gurnee and Tegmark seem impressed with their results (\u201cwe attempt to extract an actual map of the world!\u201d) the fact at geography can be weakly but imperfectly inferred from language corpora\u2014 is actually already well-known, A thread on X points out that there in fact lots of earlier results that are essentially similar, like this barely-discussed one from 2017, using a variety of older techniques:To which I will add this one, more primitive, from 2009, hinging on an earlier text-driven technique called Latent Semantic Analysis:You don\u2019t need a large language model to discover that Dallas and Austin are commonly used in sentences about Texas, and that Chicago and Milwaukee often appear together, too, in sentences about the Great Lakes. (And it is not even clear that LLMs do this any better at this than the many other older techniques studied in 2017.)  \u00a7I asked Ernie Davis about the new  paper, and he wrote back a couple hours later with a razor-sharp email, pointing out that even if you charitably called the findings that Gurnee and Tegmark documented a \u201cmodel\u201d, the system as a whole probably doesn\u2019t actually use that (much) downstream. Figure 1 of the paper places a fair number of North American cities in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. OK, so if you take one of those cities and ask for the distance to some city that is correctly placed, does it use the positions as computed by this model? If it doesn't --- and I'd bet very long odds that it doesn\u2019t do that --- \u00a0then that seems to me evidence that the model is not being used. Or, if someone wants to claim that it isn't evidence, then they would have to explain that.The whole point of models is to be able to use them downstream for other purposes, e,g,  in robotics, navigation, computer graphics, and so on.  Models that can\u2019t be  used downstream are scarcely worthy of the name, and are in no position to solve the reliability problems that plague current AI.Importantly, as Davis put it, just because you can approximate some feature (like location) doesn\u2019t mean you can reliably use it semantically for inference (is Newark off the coast of the US?).1 \u00a7Nor does it mean that an LLM has abstracted what a map is, such that it could read e.g, the maps from https://azgaar.github.io/Fantasy-Map-Generator/ and determine whether you necessarily need to to pass through Yeorian Trade Company to get from the Kingdom of Lendokia to the Herheimian Empire.\u00a7Subbarao (Rao) Kambhampati nailed the underlying issue well with this sarcastic tweet:Nobody serious thinks that Google Search has a model of physics in any meaningful sense of the word. (Rao notes that his tongue was in cheek). Just because there is (in this case) a correlation between the number of web hits and physical reality, doesn\u2019t mean Google Search has a model of physics that could e,g. guide a domestic robot.  Yes, Google Search accounting might sometimes get things right, because the ways that people use language on the web correlates to some degree the world. But doesn\u2019t mean you can rely on the variable number of Google hits as a physical model of the world. It will work for some things but not others. If you want trustworthy AI, this ain\u2019t it.\u00a7Every week or three somebody tries to persuade me that GPT has miraculously learned to play chess, but inevitably someone else reports that the latest systems still regularly maks illegal moves like these, that no human player with even modest competence would ever make:To be sure, GPT can sometimes play a decent (never world-class) game of case by correlating against some massive library of chess games that it has no doubt been trained on. But even when it does, it still doesn\u2019t really model the rules of chess well enough to stick to them. It\u2019s the same problem: correlations are fragile, and you can\u2019t count on them. I would conjecture that you can\u2019t say to ChatGPT, let\u2019s play a game of chess and then (say) 37 moves in pause, and get it to reliably answer how many white bishops are left on the board, nor to explain what happened to some pawn that had been taken a few moves earlier.  The system\u2019s guess about moves in correlation space doesn\u2019t correspond to an actual board that could be analyzed in unexpected ways. Maybe there is a state in game space represented (to use technical language) but there is no semantic model that could be used in flexible ways.Pretty much every fantasy I have ever heard about GPT-5 doesn\u2019t reckon with that fact, the fact that the correlational regime doesn\u2019t yield flexible models that can reliably support inferences on novel questions. (Any military application you might imagine would be toast for precisely that reason.)Without flexible underlying models that can reliably support inferences on novel questions, we can expect more of the same of what we are seeing over and over now:  more hallucinations, more reasoning that is hit or miss, and nothing like the stability we should insist on for future AI.\u00a7In The Information, the reporter Kaya Yurieff just tried out LinkedIn\u2019s new OpenAI powered assistant, and found the usual schmeer of plausible errors, same truth mixed with BS we have come to expect over and over again:It\u2019s actually the same issue. The system doesn\u2019t have a semantically valid model of what Yurieff has actually done with her life, just correlations in word space. It\u2019s maybe plausible that she interviewed MrBeast, but she didn\u2019t. There is no internal model of what she actually did, and hence no capacity to support reliable inference, hence no guarantee that anything it writes about her will be true. To encapsulate the heart of what Ernie Davis and I said at length in our 2019 book Rebooting AI, AI is unlikely to ever be trustworthy if its makers continue to skip the step of having explicit cognitive models of the world. Nothing in Gurnee and Tegmark\u2019s new results change that. Some corpus statistics will correlate well with world, some will wind up lost in the Atlantic sea. And here is why all this matters:  safety, which is what Tegmark really cares about, is not going to emerge anytime soon, and probably ever, from hit-or-miss systems that substitute correlation for a factual, structured, interrogable representations of the world. And pretending that they might is not going to get us closer to safe AI.

Rumors that LLMs have solved then hallucination problem are greatly exaggerated. 9 months later\u2014an eternity in current AI\u2014it\u2019s stilly common for LLMs to spout complete, utter bullshit.  Here\u2019s an example from ChatGPT last week that cracks me up, sent to me on X by LibraryThing creator Tim Spalding:(No, and thanks for asking, I don\u2019t have a pet chicken, nor a pet of any species Henrietta; I do like to take inspiration from my children, but neither of them are named Henrietta, either.).Henrietta is nothing though compared to this example, from last night from the latest update to Microsoft Bing, courtesy the computer scientist Denny Vrandecic.By my count, though I acknowledge I may have missed one, there are at least 7 falsehoods.

Wise idea for them, not so much for the buyers?Five reasons why I wouldn\u2019t make that investment:The profit isn\u2019t there. Supposedly OpenAI is on track to make a billion dollars in revenue this year, butThat projection probably comes from their two best quarters, and some data suggest their spectacular growth has already been a slow down after the amazing initial takeoff.A billion dollars in revenue is not a billion dollars in profit; it\u2019s extremely expensive to train these models, and fairly expensive just to operate them. (And as I understand it, OpenAI has to share their profits with Microsoft, as part of the recent Microsoft investment.) Current models still have a lot of problems, necessitating future models. Future models will likely be bigger models, even more expensive to train, even more expensive to operate, further reducing profits.There is a ton of pending litigation, with multiple lawsuits from artists and writers, and rumors of a major NYT lawsuit coming. (\u201cOpenAI could be fined up to $150,000 for each piece of infringing content\u201d, according the report, and there could be millions of such pieces). If OpenAI were obliged to retrain models only on materials for which they had consent, it significantly would weaken their results, and cost a great deal of money to do that retraining. Retraining repeatedly would be extremely costly. In the current state, even small changes to the underlying database might require complete retraining. Imagine if every copyright strike demanded  millions of dollar in retraining.There\u2019s not a huge moat here to protect OpenAI from competitors. The central technology at OpenAI (as far as anyone knows) is large language models, and many other companies know how to build them. Some are even open-sourcing competing models, and the competing models are developing quickly. The competitors may not (yet) be as good, but they are free, which will suit some customers fine. How much is the OpenAI brand name worth? (Example: a lot of the initial use may have been driven by undergrads and high school students writing term papers. Students don\u2019t as rule have a lot of money; they may quickly turn to free alternatives.)Big customers are still skittish; lots of people are trying LLMs, but JP Morgan, Apple, and others have bans on their use, at least partly motivated around concerns about data leaks, but reliability is a problem too. Hallucinations are a huge, unsolved issue.LLMs will likely never deliver on the promise that they are somehow close to AGI. Even now, GPT can\u2019t be trusted to follow the rules of chess, for example, and those rules are stated directly (probably multiple times) in the training set. Explicit verbal instruction is key in training human employees, and LLMs aren\u2019t very good at following those instructions. It might be OK in domains where 70% correct is OK, but unlikely to be acceptable in mission-critical applications.I have no doubt, of course, that some AI companies will eventually merit these stratospheric valuations, but I am not convinced that a pure LLM play ever will.

{"title": "Elegant and powerful new result that seriously undermines large language models", "link": "https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/elegant-and-powerful-new-result-that", "date": "2023-09-22T20:50:21.341Z", "content": "Wowed by a new paper I just read and wish I had thought to write myself.Lukas Berglund and others, led by Owain Evans, asked a simple, powerful, elegant question: can LLMs trained on A is B infer automatically that B is A? The shocking (yet, in historical context, see below, unsurprising) answer is no:On made-up facts, in a first experiment, the model was at zero percent correct, on celebrities, in a second experiment, performance was still dismal.Can we really say we are close to AGI, when the training set must contain billions of examples of symmetrical relationships, many closely related to these, and the system still stumbles on such an elementary relationship?Here\u2019s the paper; well-worth reading:Berglund et al, 2023\u00a7What the otherwise fabulous paper failed to note in its initial version is that the history on this one is really, really deep.To begin with, this kind of failure actually goes back to my own  2001 book Algebraic Mind, which focused extensively on the failure of earlier multilayer neural networks to freely generalize universal relationships, and which gave principled reasons to anticipate such failures from these architectures. None of what I raised then has really been adequately addressed in the intervening decades. The core problem, as I pointed out then, is that in many real world problems, you can never fully cover the space of possible examples, and in a broad class of heavily-data-driven systems like LLMs that lack explicit variables and operations over variables, you are out of luck when you try to extrapolate beyond that space of training examples.  Was true then, still true now.But what\u2019s really mind-blowing here is not just that the paper vindicates a lot of what I have been saying, but the specific example was literally at the center of one of the first modern critiques of neural networks, even earlier: Fodor and Pylyshyn, 1988, published in Cognition. Much of Fodor and Pylyshyn\u2019s critique hovers around the systematicity of thought, with this passage I paste in below (and several others) directly anticipating the new paper. If you really understand the world, you should be able to understand a in relation to b, and b in relation to a; we expect even nonverbal cognitive creatures to be able to do that:Forty one years later, neural networks (at least of the popular variety) still struggle with this. They still remain pointillistic masses of blurry memory, never as systematic as reasoning machines ought to be.\u00a7What I mean by pointillistic is that what they answer  very much depends on the precise details of what is asked and on what happens to be in the training set. In a DM, Evans gave me this illuminating comparison. GPT-4 tends to gets questions like this correct, as noted in the papereven though it can answer theseyet it can get theseAs Evans summarized, models that have memorized \"Tom Cruise's parent is Mary Lee Pfeiffer\" in training, fail to generalize to the question \"Who is Mary Lee Pfeiffer the parent of?\". But if the memorized fact is included in the prompt, models succeed.It\u2019s nice that it can get the latter, matching a template, but problematic that they can\u2019t take an abstraction that they superficially get in one context and generalize it another; you shouldn\u2019t have to ask it that way to get the answer you need.1\u00a7My sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu shot through the roof when I wrote to Evans to congratulate him on the result, saying I would write it up here in this Suvtack. Evans wrote  \u201cGreat. I'm excited to get more eyes on this result. Some people were very surprised and thought that models couldn't have such a basic limitation.\u201d What struck me about  people\u2019s refusal to believe his result is that in 1998 I had a very closely-related result and very similar reaction. Neural networks of the day had a great deal of trouble generalizing identity. But I couldn\u2019t get anyone to listen. Most people simply didn\u2019t believe me; almost none appreciated the significance of the result. One researcher (in a peer review) accused me of a \u201cterrorist attack on connectionism [neural networks]\u201d; it was two decades before the central point of my result \u2013 distribution shift - became widely recognized as a central problem. The will to believe in neural networks is frequently so strong that counterevidence is often dismissed or ignored, for much too long. I hope that won\u2019t happen on this one.\u00a7In math, when one make a conjecture, a simple counterexample suffices. If I say all odd numbers are prime, 1, 3, 5, and 7 may count in my favor, but at 9 the game is over.In neural network discussion, people are often impressed by successes, and pay far too little regard to what failures are trying to tell them. This symmetry fail is mighty big, a mighty persistent error that has endured for decades. It\u2019s such a clear, sharp failure in reasoning it tempts me to simply stop thinking and writing about large language models altogether. If, after training on virtually the entire internet,  you know Tom is Mary Lee\u2018s son, but can\u2019t figure out without special prompting that Mary Lee therefore is Tom\u2019s mother, you have no business running all the world\u2019s software. It\u2019s just a matter before people start to realize that we need some genuinely new ideas in the field, either new mechanisms (perhaps neurosymbolic2), or different approaches altogether. ShareGary Marcus\u2019s most important work remains his 2001 book, The Algebraic Mind, which anticipates current issues with hallucination, distribution shift, generalization, factuality and compositionality, all still central to the field.Subscribe1It\u2019s tempting to look for cases where humans also have retrieval failures, but I would not want a calculator to answer 999.252 x 13.1 slower and less accurately than 100.000 x 13 just because a human would. Computers should be expected to make optimal use of information given, regardless of human limitations.2Bing uses some neurosymbolic supplementation to pure LLM\u2019s, with some benefit on these type of problems, where there are known facts, but it is not yet clear how general the benefit is, and I would expect it to have trouble on the made-up facts that were used in Experiment 1."}

Since then everything has changed, and nothing has changed.Well, not really; that last sentence just sounded nice. In reality, only a few things have changed, most have not.What has changedWe have vastly more attention on AI policy, throughout the world, and I definitely give the pause letter (which I signed but didn\u2019t write) some credit for that. Governments across the globe have stepped up their game, holding public hearings (great!) and closed-door meetings (hmm) trying to figure out what we should about AI.The field has continued to make advances. DALL-E 3 looks genuinely interesting; Google\u2019s latest Bard, according to the New York Times, is improved, but still erratic.Ironically, GPT-5\u2013which is essentially the only thing that the pause letter (if you read it carefully) actually proposed to pause\u2014does actually seem to be on pause, if Sam Altman\u2019s May Senate testimony meant what I think it did. He said, and I quote, \u201cWe are not currently training what will be GPT-5. We don\u2019t have plans to do it in the next six months.\u201d (Why not? Altman didn\u2019t say. My own guess is that between the release of GPT-4 in November 2022 and the May  2023 testimony OpenAI ran some preliminary tests and decided that the system would not meet expectations. Given that the costs for training would perhaps be measured in the hundreds of millions of dollars, they decided to hold off pending new ideas for improvements.)Some bona fide AI legislation has been crafted, including, in the US, a bipartisan bill led by Ted Lieu calling for an AI Commission, and a bipartisan bill by Hawley and Blumenthal that gratifyingly looks a lot like the things I called for in my testimony before their committee, emphasizing transparency, auditing and an FDA-like licensing process. The White House worked together with industry leaders to craft a set of voluntary guidelines.The UN is taking global AI policy very seriously (something I emphasized in my TED Talk), building a high-level advisory body at the request of Secretary General Guterres.What has not changed, and what we have not seenAt least in the United States, policy around AI is still largely notional, not actual. Voluntary guidelines aren\u2019t laws, and they aren\u2019t enforcement mechanisms, either; companies can still do as they please. The Hawley-Blumenthal proposal largely got lost in the press around the much less-specific Schumer-led closed door meeting that followed it by a day; maybe it will become law, maybe it will not. The EU AI Act is on its way, but still being negotiated, and again, not yet, actual law. The UN has called for action, but not yet made clear what action that might be.Large language models continue to be unreliable. None of the basic issues that I have been harping on for the last 20 years has actually been solved. Large language models still make stuff up (\u201challucinate\u201d), still can\u2019t be trusted in their reasoning, and remain unreliable. That Times headline yesterday about Google\u2019s latest Bard edition says it all, \u201cGoogle\u2019s Bard Just Got More Powerful. It\u2019s Still Erratic.\u201d  A good part of my own concerns about AI revolve around that erratic nature; society is placing more and more trust in a technology that simply has not yet earned that trust. As a society, we still don\u2019t really have any plan whatsoever about what we might do to mitigate long-term risks. Current AI is pretty dumb in many respects, but what would we do if superintelligent AI really were at some point imminent, and posed some sort of genuine threat, eg around a new form of bioweapon attack? We have far too little machinery in place to surveil or address such threats.The big companies have all pledged fealty to transparency, but none of them will actually tells us what\u2019s in their data sets. (The voluntary guidelines didn\u2019t address this). If we don\u2019t know what is in the data sets, we can\u2019t know what biases these systems will spread through society if they are widely used, we can\u2019t know the extent to which individual content creatore are being exploited, and worse any outside efforts to mitigate risks are greatly undermined. We can\u2019t properly assess the ability of these systems to generalize without understanding the relation between their training data and their output. Without that, addressing risks is like trying to dry a camp full of dishes with a single rag slopping water around.\u00a7I have some mild sense of regretting having signed the pause letter, not because of anything it actually said, but because of how it has repeatedly been politicized and misinterpreted. I have been accused of trying to hype AI (certainly not my intention), people have miscontrued the letter as banning all AI research (which is not what it called for, and not something I would support), and so on.  But I sure am glad it opened the conversation.We are obviously never going to have a moratorium anytime in the near-term. The apparent economics of AI (we will see if they yet come to pass as imagined) are too seductive to too many, to people building AI companies, to people investing in AI companies, to people getting paid 6 and even 7 digit salaries, and to people expecting campaign donations from big tech companies. The question is, if we don\u2019t pause AI, what will we do to mitigate the many risks \u2013 from accidental misinformation (defamation, medical misinformation)  and wholesale deliberate disinformation (which may manipulate our elections and our markets) to increases in cybercrime and malware, to AI-generated bioweapons, and so forth \u2013 and who will bear the costs.Next time: what should we do? ShareGary Marcus testified about all this before the US Senate in May. He\u2019s cautiously optimistic that we might see actual legislation pass in the next six months, but still pretty worried about whether whatever it comes up with will be up to the job.

I want to know: will humanity still exist on Earth. What will we do, as our birth planet succumbs? I\u2019m insatiably curious about the long-term future.\u201dWhen I first arrived in Vancouver in 2018, practically everyone I met said, \u201cyou have to meet Karen.\u201d  Eventually I did, and we quickly became friends, and eventually close collaborators.  In the middle of the pandemic, when I was feeling pretty lost, she helped revitalize me. Few people I have met are as broad as she was, able to say something smart and surprising about pretty much anything we ever talked about from politics to music to science to technology. Technically speaking, Karen was in the Geography department at UBC, in Vancouver, but no pigeonhole could ever possibly capture her. Her interests and expertise were vast, ranging from animal communication to water rights; she seemed to know everybody, from the former mayor to cabinet ministers, and had immensely practical ideas about just about everything. She seemed to have lived everywhere and done everything. She was a devoted mother to her daughters, a devoted wife to her husband, an academic, a global adventurer, a political leader around water rights, and also an entrepreneur, most recently as VP of Strategy for an educational technology company Riipen, which she joined after they had acquired a company of her own. (She even had a whole third career, aside from her best-known academic work, writing a pair of bestsellers under a nom de plume, about cooking and children.) 2023 was, at least initially, her year. Her book The Sounds of Life, in many ways about AI -- how AI might help us communicate better with animals -- had just come out the previous fall, and was immediately wildly successful. She was on sabbatical at Harvard, gave a fantastic TED talk on the prospects of using AI to decipher animal communication, and was constantly doing podcasts and interviews. Somehow in her spare time, behind the scenes, she joined Anka Reuel and me in co-launching ca-tai.org, the Center for the Advancement of Trustworthy AI, working with us on it until almost her final days. Literally every time we spoke, I learned something from Karen. Anka felt the same,  \u201cAfter every meeting with Karen, I went back to my partner and told him about all the things I learned from her that day. About how in awe I was with this women who barely knew me but who shared her knowledge and time and wisdom with me so graciously, without any agenda, just to help a young woman grow as a professional and human being.\u201dAnd then all of the sudden, the music stopped. In June, having just spoken at the Aspen Ideas Festival, Karen felt ill, and never recovered. On August 14, she passed away. It is almost unfathomable to me that she is gone. \u00a7The Sounds of Life, which she somehow managed to write during the early isolation of Covid-19, was really just a small part of a larger treatise she wanted to write. The rest will appear in a second book early next year, called Gaia\u2019s Web, about the intersection between digital technology and the environment. According to the publisher\u2019s web page, it will be \u201cA riveting exploration of one of the most important dilemmas of our time: will digital technology accelerate environmental degradation, or could it play a role in ecological regeneration?\u201dIn her TED talk, Karen imagined a world in which AI and machine learning helped to bring us humans deeper into the world of animals. She closed by asking us to imagine an orca giving a TED talk:And maybe one day in a speculative future, instead of a human here on stage, maybe bioacoustics would enable an orca to give a TED talk.The audience laughed \u2014 and then Karen characteristically doubled down, pushing the thought experiment far past what initially sounded like a quick throwaway line, into a far richer image that brought tears to many eyes, beautifully underscoring her own tremendous love of nature, as she imagined what the orcas might care to discuss, when it was their turn on the stage:Why not? Sharing orca stories about dodging ships and seismic blasts and human hunters, stories about desperately seeking the last remaining salmon, stories about trying to survive on this beautiful planet in this crazy moment in our era of untethered human creativity and unprecedented environmental emergency. Now those would be ideas worth spreading.\u00a7I wasn\u2019t only the person who saw the magic in Karen, not by a long shot.  In the words of Chris Anderson, the head of TED, in an email to me,Karen truly lit up the last TED Conference. It was apparent to everyone there that she was a remarkable person. Not just in the brilliance of her work and of her eloquence. But in the way that she stood for a deep and beautiful respect for life in all its crazy amazingness. To have this taken from us makes no sense. We can only do what we can to honor her legacy and the values she stood for.You can read more about Karen and her many books and articles at https://karenbakker.org.Gary Marcus is a cognitive scientist and AI researcher, who learned much of what he knows about how governments do and don\u2019t work, and a whole lot more, from Karen Bakker.

{"title": "Doug Lenat, 1950-2023", "link": "https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/doug-lenat-1950-2023", "date": "2023-09-01T17:38:54.982Z", "content": "Doug Lenat was one of the most brilliant, acerbically funny people I have ever met. If people like Marvin Minsky, John McCarthy, and Allen Newell were among the first to think deeply about how symbolic AI, in which machines manipulate explicit verbal-like representations, might work, Doug was the first to try really hard to make it actually work. I have spent my whole career arguing for consilience between neural networks and symbolic AI, and on the strictly symbolic side of that equation, Lenat was light-years ahead of me, not just more deeply embedded in those trenches than I, but the architect of many of those trenches. Lenat spent the last 40 years of his life launching and directing a project called Cyc, an intense effort to codify all of common sense in machine-interpretable form. Too few people thinking about AI today even know what that project is. Many who do, write it off as a failure. Cyc (and the parent company, Cycorp, that Lenat formed to incubate it) never exploded commercially \u2013 but hardly anybody ever gives it credit for the fact that it is still in business 40 years later; very very few AI companies have survived that long.1 My own view is that Cyc has been neither a success nor a failure, but somewhere in between:  I see it as a ground-breaking, clarion experiment that never fully gelled. No, Cyc didn\u2019t set the world on fire, but yes, it will seem more and more important in hindsight, as we eventually make real progress towards artificial general intelligence. Most young AI researchers have never even heard about it. But every single one of them should know something about Cyc. They don\u2019t need to like it, but they should understand what it was, and what it tried to do, and what they might do instead to accomplish the same goals. Not because Cyc will get used out of the box, as some sort of drop-in replacement for Large Language Models, but because what Lenat tried to do - to get machines to represent and reason about common sense \u2014 still must be done. Yejin Choi\u2019s wonderful 2023 TED talk, Why AI is incredibly smart and shockingly stupid, followed directly in that tradition, explaining why common sense is still, despite their apparent success, lacking in current AI systems. (My 2019 book with Ernie Davis, Rebooting AI was very much on the same topic.)Metaphorically, Lenat tried to find a path across the mountain of common sense, the millions of things we know about the world but rarely articulate. He didn\u2019t fully succeed \u2013 we will need a different path \u2013 but he picked the critical mountain that we still must cross. That\u2019s what Lenat, Choi, Davis, and I have all been trying to say, and it\u2019s exactly where Large Language Models struggle, over and over. To take but one of a zillion constantly changing examples, this very morning someone sent me, with Google Bard mixing together truth with obvious nonsense, in completely fluent paragraphs:Depending on the wording, any given model might or might not get questions like that right on any given day; Large Language Models tend to be accurate in some wordings, inaccurate in others. From them we sometimes see an illusion of common sense, depending on the vagaries of what the training set is and the precise wording of a question, but something is obviously still missing. And even if this specific example is patched up, there will inevitably be others of a similar flavor. Cyc is an effort to find a deeper, more robust answer.As the AI researcher Ken Forbus of Northwestern University put it to me in an email this morning, \u201cThe Cyc project was the first demonstration that symbolic representations and reasoning can scale to capture significant portions of commonsense. While today billion-fact knowledge bases are common in industry, Cyc remains the most advanced in terms of expressiveness, capturing more of the range of thoughts that humans are capable of.  My group has been using Cyc\u2019s representations in our research for decades\u2026 Our field would do well to learn more from the Cyc project.\u201d A Google researcher, Muktha Ananda, Director of their Learning Platform, wrote condolences to me this morning, \u201cI have always been a great admirer of [Lenat\u2019s] vision, perseverance and tenacity. His work on Cyc was a great source of inspiration for my own journey into knowledge graphs/webs.\u201d \u00a7Over the last year, Doug and I tried to write a long, complex paper that we never got to finish. Cyc was both awesome in its scope, and unwieldy in its implementation. The biggest problem with Cyc from an academic perspective is that it\u2019s proprietary. To help more people understand it, I tried to bring out of him what lessons he learned from Cyc, for a future generation of researchers to use. Why did it work as well as it did when it did, why did fail when it did, what was hard to implement, and what did he wish that he had done differently? We had nearly 40,000 words, sprawling, not yet fully organized, yet filled with wisdom. It was part science, part oral history.  Needless to say, it takes a long time to organize and polish something of that length. In between our other commitments, we were making slow but steady progress. And then in the new year, I got busy with AI policy, and he got sick; progress slowed. Closer to the end, he wrote a shorter, tighter paper, building in part on the work we had done together. When he realized that he did not have much time left,  we agreed that I would help polish the shorter manuscript, a junior partner in what we both knew would likely be his last paper. One of his last emails to me, about six weeks ago, was an entreaty to get the paper out ASAP; on July 31, after a nerve-wracking false-start, it came out, on arXiv, Getting from Generative AI to Trustworthy AI: What LLMs might learn from Cyc.  The brief article is simultaneously a review of what Cyc tried to do, an encapsulation of what we should expect from genuine artificial intelligence, and a call for reconciliation between the deep symbolic tradition that he worked in with modern Large Language Models.  In his honor, I hope you will find time to read it.Gary Marcus has focused his career on integrating neural networks and symbolic approaches; he still hopes that will happen.Please considering sharing this post, in Doug\u2019s memoryShareSubscribe1For perspective Babylon Health, a medical AI company once valued at about $2 billion, went bankrupt yesterday, at the age of 10; Argo.ai, also once valued at billions, lasted six."}

Screenshot from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_voting. As I wrote the other day, p(doom) is somewhat-tongue-in-cheek shorthand for the probability that we are all going to die from some AI-induced extinction event. I rather doubt that will happen, but I am not sure that it won\u2019t.What I am sure of, though, is that our chances to avoid serious consequences aren\u2019t great if we control neither AI nor the companies that make AI. The goal of the companies is return to shareholders, not to return to humanity.  The default right now is regulatory capture: the companies will make the rules, telling the governments what they are and are not comfortable with. The government will go along.  Indeed, what we have seen on the AI front so far in the US, for the most part, is voluntary guidelines \u2013 stuff that the companies are comfortable with.That has meant, for example, no tangible progress on getting the big companies to commit to revealing what data their models were trained on; we have transparency in name, but not in deed. Without data transparency, we can\u2019t make sure our models are without bias, or even know the sources of the biases they hide within, we can\u2019t truly understand the scope and limits of their generalization (which is central to understanding what they might do in unexpected circumstances) and we are hamstrung in our ability to mitigate their harmful consequences: what is unknown is hard to fix. If you shouldn\u2019t fix what ain\u2019t broke, you can\u2019t fix what you don\u2019t know.Fact is, we have not seen enough independence from Big Tech, in the current government, or any previous governments in recent memory. For fifteen years we have known that social media is a problem, and yet we can\u2019t even get a basic privacy bill passed.  Section 230 has been a disaster.If we are to get the right regulatory regime for AI \u2013 one that protects consumers, without stifling innovation \u2013 we are going to need government to step up. I wish I could say I was more optimistic.\u00a7Powerful corporate lobbying is clearly a huge problem. Maybe the two-party system is another. Andrew Yang made some pretty good arguments against the two-party system last week in a debate hosted by John Donavan and the recently rechristened Open for Debate (formerly Intelligence Squared).  He also made some powerful arguments for ranked-choice voting.The most compelling example he gave was about what happened recently in Alaska, when they abandoned the traditional party based primary system, in favor of a non-partisan open primary with ranked-choice-voting. The Republican Lisa Murkowski, a voice of independence never fully aligned either with Democrats or Republicans,  managed to avoid being primaried, unlike nearly every other Republican who has tried to maintained a measure of independence in the Trump era. Ranked-choice voting was probably also key to Mary Peltola\u2019s upset victory, allowing her to become the first Alaska Native member of Congress.  Yang\u2019s discussion left me wondering whether ranked-choice voting might be a way to empower outsiders that could stand up to Big Tech more directly to participate in government.As Yang pointed out, ranked-choice voting also might be our best shot at avoiding an authoritarian turn, absolutely essential to a positive AI future.To be fair, I don\u2019t know any of this for sure; I am not an expert in politics or voting, and there are some other worthy variations on the same theme of alternative voting approaches. But I think ranked-choice-voting (or some similar alternative) is very much worth serious consideration. As Miles Taylor, former chief of staff at the US Department of Homeland Security, put it to me in a text message, \u201cranked-choiced-voting is \u2026  one of the wonder drugs for democracy.\u201dIf it can help us get to a good place with AI policy, I am all in.p.s.

In the limit, of course, the probability is one, and too depressing1 to talk about in polite society. When the universe goes down, all of our descendants, if we have any left, will go down with the ship.But we blunder on. When people talk about p(doom) they are really talking about the chance that humans will go extinct soon, say in the next hundred years. I was at a workshop in the Bay Area recently, and the \u201cicebreaker\u201d was, \u201csay your name and give p(doom)\u201d.  Usually when people are talking about p(doom), they are thinking specifically about AI \u2013 could AI kill us all? What\u2019s the odds of that? A lot of people in Silicon Valley are pretty worried that p(doom) might be something other than zero; some even seem to put the number at ten percent or higher. (Eliezer Yudkowsky seems to put it at near 100%). One survey, which was not perhaps entirely representative, put it a lot higher than that. And that was before GPT-4 which some people (not me) think somehow increases the odds of doom.Personally, despite the name of this essay, I am not all that worried about humans going extinct anytime very soon. It\u2019s hard for me to construct a realistic scenario of literal, full-on extinction that I take seriously. We are a pretty resourceful species, spread throughout the globe. Covid was pretty terrible, but it didn\u2019t come remotely close to killing us all (about 1 in a 1000 humans died). Nuclear war would kill a very large number of people, and set back civilization immensely, but I doubt that literally every human in every corner of the earth would die. But who cares what I think?The fact that I, sitting on my couch, can\u2019t think of a compelling scenario in which machines, directly or indirectly, on purpose or by accident, of their own volition or via the deliberate commands of a madman , could kill us all doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t happen.  Poverty-of-the-imagination arguments don\u2019t have a great track record. (Some onlookers couldn\u2019t possibly imagine that heavier-than-air aircraft could fly, others couldn\u2019t imagine people would be able build  nuclear weapons;  even in the Reagan era I didn\u2019t imagine that a game show host could become President, etc).  There are in fact already some scenarios that are faintly imaginable now (e.g. bad actors using machines to create novel toxins, in ways that go awry), and over time could be more. The reality is we just aren\u2019t really good at imagining technology fifty or one hundred years out. Just because we can\u2019t imagine something doesn\u2019t mean it might now happen in 50 years. Who among us anticipated social networks with a billion users in 1990? Or any of their side effects on mental health or public discourse, and perhaps even geopolitics? Meanwhile, p(doom) per se is not the only thing we should be worried about. Perhaps extinction is vanishingly unlikely, but what I will call \ud835\udc29(\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1e) \u2013 the chance that an incident that kills (say) one percent or more of the population, seems a lot higher. For literal extinction, you would have to kill every human in every nook and cranny on earth; that\u2019s hard, even if you do it on purpose. Catastrophe is a lot easier to imagine. I can think of a LOT of scenarios where that could come to pass (e.g., bad actors using AI to short the stock market could try, successfully, to shut down the power grid and the internet in the US, and the US could wrongly blame Russia, and conflict could ensure and escalate into a full-on physical war). When Sam Altman said in May at our Senate hearing \u201cMy worst fears are that we cause significant, we, the field, the technology, the industry \u2014 cause significant harm to the world\u201d he was not wrong. Can any of us truly say that\u2019s simply not possible?\u00a7\u00a0Yet a really large fraction of the AI and AI-adjacent community doesn\u2019t really want to talk about any of this at all. Many scoff at the whole idea of discussing p(doom), and few seem to want to discuss p(catastrophe) either, when I try to bring it up. Just a couple days ago, one serious computer scientist asserted to me that \u201cclimate change is real and \"AI Risk\" is not\u201d, as if we were wasting time even thinking about the problem.One common argument is that we have no idea how to estimate it, another that most of the common scenarios proposed sound like science-fiction.Neither counter remotely helps me sleep at night.The problem with the latter argument is that science-fiction does sometimes come true. We didn\u2019t have a lot of orbiting satellites when Arthur C Clarke first wrote about them, now we have thousands. Star Trek communicators came (in the form of Motorola flip phones) and have now long since been left in the dust. The problem with the former argument\u2014that we have no idea how to estimate p(doom)\u2014is twofold. First, it confuses epistemology (what we can know and how we can come to know it) with probability. Just because we can\u2019t estimate something well doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t kill us.  Unfortunately, the fact that we can\u2019t predict the course of technology with any precision even a decade out doesn\u2019t magically immunize us from its effects, nor relieve us of a moral responsbility to try to take precautions. We can\u2019t really estimate the probability that synthetic biology will kill us all, but we that shouldn\u2019t stop us from taking precautions.What\u2019s \ud835\udc29(\ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc25 \ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1e)? We probably can\u2019t predict it with precision; there many unknowns. Any confidence interval would necessarily be broad. But does that mean we shouldn\u2019t really worry about biological catastrophe? Or course not.Meanwhile, we humans have a rather bad history of neglecting issues that are both serious and dark on the grounds that they rest on things we haven\u2019t figured out. Here\u2019s a summary of the situation with respect to climate in the 1970s:From  \u201cSixty years of climate change warning: the signs that were missed (and ignored)\u201d published by the Guardian in 2021Sound familiar? The phrase \ud835\udc29(\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc26) might be new, but the practicing of ridiculing doomers goes back at least a half century. In the case of climate change, those who did the ridicule were on the wrong side of history. \u00a7Another common argument is to say that there is no reason whatsoever to expect AI to control (or annihilate) humans. Yann LeCun wrote a long screed along these lines (which Steve Pinker later endorsed), saying we don\u2019t need to worry about AI achieving dominance. Some of what he says is right, but there\u2019s a fallacy here, too. LeCun\u2019s premise that the smartest doesn\u2019t always win is of course right but his argument as a whole sputters out in the end:LeCun\u2019s conclusion \u2014that humans will always set the agenda\u2014might be true, but he hasn\u2019t given a real argument.  Instead LeCun has actually assumed his conclusion\u2014a cardinal sin in logic\u2014as his premise. The whole thing is circular:  we will be able to set the agenda therefore we will be able to set the agenda. The question is not whether we want to design AI to be like a supersmart-but-non-dominating staff member (obviously we are trying), but whether we can.  Unfortunately, LeCun gives us no hint as how to we might, and no guarantee that doing so is even possible.2When I think about how poor his company (Meta) is even at making LLMs that don\u2019t hallucinate, I get worried. And when I think about Meta\u2019s track record, for emphasizing profit versus global good,  I get even more worried.If push came to shove, could we have confidence that Meta (or any other big tech company) would build maximally safe but perhaps less profitable AI rather than a maximally profitable but possibly less safe AI, given the choice?Sometimes all you can do is laugh.As ed tech researcher Nirmal Patel put it last night, \u201dProbability of AI doom depends on both technology capabilities and nature of world leaders. We have atomic bombs and one crazy leader is what it will take for doom\u201d; eventually, we might have AI that is equally risky in the hands of a desperate, deranged leader.  Should we think about how to prepare for such scenarios now? Or later? \u00a7None of this means of course that I suddenly think that we are close to super-smart machines. (Spoiler alert: we are not). But if and when we get there, will they be dominating? Non-dominating? The honest answer is we haven\u2019t a clue. Will errant dictators use them for profit or political gain? All we have is a bunch of analogies.Which makes actually calculating p(doom) fiendishly hard. What you want is sort of like this, a calculator someone (pausai.info) is in the process of putting together on the web:hsndy-dandy p(doom) calculatorYou can try it out; you set your best guesses for a bunch of sliders, and out comes your own personal p(doom) estimate, suitable for discussing at Silicon Valley cocktail parties. \u00a7\u00a0Aryeh Englander, a graduate student at the University of Maryland, is trying to formulate these calculates this in a considerably more detailed way, writing his entire dissertation around trying to make serious, thoughtful calculations on p(doom) - and p(catastophe) as well \u2013  with proper confidence intervals, and so on. He pointed me to a 147 page analysis that already exists, and a more recent technical note from earlier this week, and hopes to produce an even deeper analysis. (As he notes the term p(doom) is itself just tongue-in-cheek shorthand, a sort of fieldwide in-joke to quickly point up some more nuanced concepts that he will treat at length.)As Englander well knows, we will never get perfect estimates, but even imperfect estimates might help guide policy decisions as we try to balance attention to short-term and long-term risks in AI. In his words, in an email earlier this week:We only really care about \"p(doom)\" or the like as it relates to specific decisions. In particular, I think the reason most people in policy discussions care about something like p(doom) is because for many people higher default p(doom) means they're willing to make larger tradeoffs to reduce that risk. For example, if your p(doom) is very low then you might not want to restrict AI progress in any way just because of some remote possibility of catastrophe (although you might want to regulate AI for other reasons!). But if your p(doom) is higher then you start being willing to make harder and harder sacrifices to avoid really grave outcomes.\u201d It\u2019s therefore worth getting a rough idea of the number, even if we can\u2019t achieve consensus on the exact number. With policy decisions at stake, the more confidence we can place in the estimate, the better. But imprecision is not an excuse for  inaction. \u00a7 I don\u2019t self-identify as a \u201cdoomer\u201d (unlike say Eliezer Yudkowsky who may). Unlike Yudkowsky I don\u2019t think the probabilities are high enough\u2014or imminent enough- to warrant bombing data centers any time soon. (Or probably ever.)But all the ridicule I am seeing just doesn\u2019t make sense.  Some of the specific arguments Yudkowsky and Bostrom have made may well be weak, but there is no solid argument that the number is zero, or even that the risk is infinitesimal.  We waited too long on climate change; to the extent that there may be any real risk, either of outright doom or \u201cmere\u201d catastrophe, let\u2019s not wait too long on AI. \u00a7An important clarification before I conclude, prompted by thoughtful comments on an earlier draft by \u00c9mile Torres: AI risk \u2260 Superintelligence risk per se. Some of the risk from AI comes from the possibility of an uncontrollable superintelligence; a lot of it does not. Most of the public discourse around AI risk is about whether superintelligent AI (if and when it exists) will extinguish our species - an important question that deserves answers. But bluntly, uncontrollable superintelligence is by no means the only risk from AI, and from a policy perspective may not be the most important risk, given both the lowish (?) probability and the time horizon. I am, at least for now, much more worried about the overapplication of mediocre AI (eg what happens if we put large language models into running military strategy or into hiring decisions that affect millions of people) than the use of AI that might be so smart it could catch its own errors. And, as noted, I more worried about catastrophe than extinction per se. But I would count all of that as AI risk. I do think there is a lot of risk that AI will cause chaos. (Controllable superintelligence, by the way, has pretty serious risks, too, depending on who controls it, as Nirmal pointed above).Within the field, there is a lot of conflict around how to think about p(doom | superintelligence) [\u201cthe probability of doom given the existence of superintelligence\u201d, which is a special form of AI], but no matter what you feel about that p(doom | superintelligence), whether you see it as sci-fi or not, you should be worried about p(catastrophe | widespread AI adoption) [the probability of catastrophe given widespread AI adoption].  And you should care about p(catastrophe | widespread AI adoption) whatever you think about p(doom). The risks of current AI (bias, defamation, cybercrime, wholesale disinformation, etc) are already starting to be well documented and may themselves quickly escalate, and could lead to geopolitical instability even over the next few years. And what really gets the goat of people like Timnit Gebru and Abeba Birhane, not unreasonably, is that there is a good chance that any immediate effects will disproprotionately affect the dispossessed; they are very likely right about that. Do we want, for example, a world in which rich people hire human tutors and poor people get stuck with hallucinating but cheap AI tutors that take live human teachers away from the masses? It\u2019s a story for another day, but clearly you can have catastrophe without mass death, and we are heading in that direction. \u00a7One of the most intellectually honest things I have read about the whole topic is from Katja Grace, who goes through a pretty lengthy calculation on p(doom) that I won\u2019t recount here, and then lands both on the right note of humility and the fact that we still have agency. I\u2019ve boldfaced the bits I am most fond of. In conclusion: this morning when I could think more clearly 'cause I wasn't standing on a stage, I thought the overall probability of doom was 19% .. but I don't think you should listen to that very much 'cause I might change it tomorrow or something.I think an important thing to note with many of the things in these arguments is that they could actually be changed by us doing different things. Like if we put more effort into figuring out what's going on inside AI systems, that would actually change the \u2018how likely is it that we can't make AI systems do the things we want?\u2019 parameter.\"Words to live by. We aren\u2019t going to be able calculate p(doom) to three decimal places. But let\u2019s not give up on our efforts to ponder on the future just because it\u2019s hard to identify it with certainty, nor become fatalists. Let\u2019s see what we can do to maximize our chances.ShareGary Marcus is the co-author of Rebooting AI, author and editor of 6 other books, founder of two companies, CEO of ca-tai.org and host of the eight-part podcast Humans vs Machines.

No deployment, no revenue. Quoting further, \u201cNearly 70% of respondents to the S&P Global survey said they have at least one AI project in production... but about half of those companies (31% of respondents) are still in pilot or proof-of-concept stage, outnumbering those who have reached enterprise scale with an AI project (28% of total respondents).\u201d And of course not every enterprise-scale experiment will be successful.The backlash as begun. Earlier today, the cultural critic Ted Gioia was even harsher than I was, in a new essay, entitled \u201cUgly Numbers from Microsoft and ChatGPT Reveal that AI Demand is Already Shrinking\u201d, subtitled \u201cThe only areas where AI is flourishing are shamming, spamming & scamming\u201d. A few days earlier Financial Times columnist John Thornhill quoted this very newsletter, concluding with a zinger: \u201cDoubtless, Marcus will also be proved right that much of the corporate money thrown at the technology will be wasted and most start-ups will fail. But who knows what new stuff will be invented and endure? That is why God invented bubbles.\u201d  Ouch!. Some of the problems we\u2019ve known about for a long time appear  to persist. Google\u2019s latest LLM \u201cincludes Hitler, Stalin and Mussolini on a list of \"greatest\" leaders and Hitler also makes its list of \"most effective leaders\u201d\u201d, according to a news report yesterday. OpenAI has been sued a lot for a lot of reasons, but earlier this week ArsTechnica reported that  the latest potential lawsuit \u2014 this time from the New York Times \u2014 could \u201cforce OpenAI to wipe ChatGPT and start over\u201d, with OpenAI potentially \u201cfined up to $150,000 for each piece of infringing content\u201d, serious money even for OpenAI, and a potential challenge to the economics of the whole enterprise. This could be particularly devastating because Large Language  Models aren\u2019t like classical databases in which individual pieces of data can be removed at will; if any content is removed, the entire model must (so far as I understand it) be retrained, at great expense.Meanwhile, I am pretty sure Chris Christie wasn\u2019t aiming to be kind to Vivek Ramaswamy tonight at the Republican debate when he likened Ramaswamy to \u201ca guy who sounds like ChatGPT\u201d.

What did he mean by AGI in this context? To his credit, he was quite clear By AGI I mean: better than typical human performance on virtually all cognitive tasks that humans can typically do.  I think we're not too far off.  I seriously doubt it. It\u2019s also (as discussed below) not quite how he and I publicly discussed the term last year; in my view it\u2019s a subtle redefinition that dramatically moves the goal posts. Before we get to where the goal posts were, let\u2019s talk about where Legg wants to put them now: beating typical human performance more or less across the board. Are we close to that?\u00a7At first glance, you might think so. There  is no doubt, of course that machines are increasingly doing as well or close to as well as (or even better than) typical humans on a lot of benchmarks (scored exams that are standard across the industry).But it is also well-known throughout the industry that benchmarks are often quite gameable. A nice statement of this from a few years ago from a team at what was then called Facebook is this, in a 2019 review by Nie et al of what we had learned from extant benchmarks:A growing body of evidence shows that state-of-the-art models learn to exploit spurious statistical patterns in datasets... instead of learning meaning in the flexible and generalizable way that humans do.\"Basically, beating benchmarks doesn\u2019t tell you as much as you might think. Often when you do, it\u2019s a statistical artifact.The dirty little secret that pretty much everyone in the AI community knows is that doing well on a benchmark is not actually tantamount to being intelligent. This is even more true four years later, now that we have systems that ingest massive amounts of data from both public and commercial sources, quite possibly including eg sample law school and medical exams etc.Without a sense of what it is in the training corpus, it\u2019s almost impossible to conclude anything about what a machine truly understands and how general that is. You never know when the answer might more or less already be in the undisclosed training set. Beating a bunch of untrained humans on a bunch of tasks where the machine had a large amount of memorized data might not really tell us much.\u00a7\u00a0Benchmarks are a lot of work to create; there often problems with them. Machines often solve them for the wrong reasons. Building them is an unsolved problem within AI.That said, there are a lot of things for which no formal, satisfactory benchmark has been made on which I doubt machines are actually close to beating humans. Here are a few examples I sketched in a reply to Legg.We are not even close to machines that exceed the capacity of typical humans to cope with unusual circumstances while driving Humans can write summaries and reliably answer many questions about original films and television programs that they watch; I doubt LLMs (or any other extant AI technology) can do this at all. (I suggested this as an informal benchmark in 2014, see little progress)Humans can write summaries of things without hallucination; LLMs cannot do so reliably. Humans can learn rules of games like chess from modest amounts of explicit instruction; LLMs can\u2019t stick to explicit rules.When I posted some of these on X,  readers quickly pointed out other examples as well:Needless to say, the nose-picking challenge remains unsolved. Ear-scratching hasn\u2019t even been broached.And frankly, we still have a long way to go on all the things I always harp on: reasoning, compositionality, planning, factuality, and so on. Paraphrasing Yann LeCun, AI is still stuck on an off-ramp. Might be exciting, but it\u2019s not yet AGI.\u00a7Legg\u2019s comments that I quoted at the beginning continued in a clever way that implied that skeptics had been busy moving the goal posts:That some people now want to set the AGI bar so high that most humans wouldn't pass it, just shows how much progress has been made!This sounds great\u2014but it drops the basketball rim from 10 feet to 7.  Humans suck at multidigit arithmetic; that doesn\u2019t mean I would ever buy a calculator that was merely \u201cbetter than the average human\u201d or even \u201cbetter than the best human\u201d; I expect a calculator to be right every time; that\u2019s what it\u2019s there for. No AGI worth its salt would brick multidigit arithmetic.It\u2019s a huge downgrade in our goals for artificial general intelligence to say \u201cbetter than the average untrained human on many tasks\u201d; the point is that we should expect machines to do what we ask them to do; when I press the square root button on my calculator, I expect an accurate approximation to that square root; when I press the accelerator on my car, I expect the car to go forward. If I ask a chatbot to write a biography, I expect it to summarize knowledge,  not to make stuff up. An artificial general intelligence should do the things that it is asked to do, and decline to do those that it can\u2019t, and have the wisdom to know the difference. Dropping from \u201cas smart as the Star Trek computer\u201d to better than Joe Sixpack should not be our goal.\u00a7Things have actually changed, quite a bit, in a subtle way.A year and half ago, when I offered Elon Musk a bet about when AGI would come, the field generally thought my criteria were reasonable. (The Long Now foundation offer to host the bet, and  Metaculus  posted them on their prediction site). Three were things that ordinary untrained humans could do, but  two were not. 18 months ago, before the LLM euphoria, we all took for granted that AGI wasn\u2019t just about beating ordinary humans. \u00a7Legg\u2019s 2023 standard, merely beating the ordinary schmo, is far less ambitious. Whose goal post changed? Not mine. 18 months ago I offered a definition of my own, and asked Legg about it.Here\u2019s what I saidand what Legg said when asked how he would define AGIThere was no controversy back then. In my view \u201cflexible and general, with resourcefulness and reliability comparable to (or beyond) human intelligence\u201c is subtly but importantly more ambitious than \u201cbeats most (untrained) humans most of the time\u201d.What would make artificial general intelligence general is generality: the ability to cope with new things. And that\u2019s precisely where current AI is still lacking.\u00a7Let\u2019s not dumb down our standards, and wind up with a bunch of machines we can\u2019t rely on, just so that big tech can prematurely declare victory, when there is plenty of work left to do.Share Marcus on AIGary Marcus is chuffed that some of these posts were recently written up in the Financial Times.

Major automakers have been investing billions in development, while tech players \u2026 have been testing their versions in American cities.\u201d How\u2019s that working out?I hate to say I told you so, and I am by no means the only one who said so, but driverless cars (still) have a problem. That problem, which I have emphasized dozens of times over the last several years, is edge cases, out-of-the-ordinary circumstances that often confound machine learning algorithms.  The more complicated a domain is, the more unanticipated outliers there tend to be. And the real world is really complicated and messy; there\u2019s no way to list all the crazy and out of ordinary things that can happen. Nobody has yet figured out how to build a driverless car that can deal with that fact.One of the the first times I emphasized how challenging the edge case problem was for driving was in a 2016 interview, when tired of the hype, I unloaded at length. It\u2019s eerie to read the transcript now, more or less just as applicable today as it was then; nearly every word still applies:All of this apparent progress is being driven by the ability to use brute force techniques on a scale we've never used before. That originally drove Deep Blue for chess and the Atari game system stuff. It's driven most of what people are excited about. At the same time, it's not extendable to the real world if you're talking about domestic robots in the home or driving in the streets.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2026 think about driverless cars. What you find is that in the common situations, they're great. If you put them in clear weather in Palo Alto, they're terrific. If you put them where there's snow or there's rain or there's something they haven't seen before, it's difficult for them. There was a great piece by Steven Levy about the Google automatic car factory, where he talked about how the great triumph of late 2015 was that they finally got these systems to recognize leaves.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It's great that they do recognize leaves, but there're a lot of scenarios like that, where if there's something that's not that common, there's not that much data. You and I can reason with common sense. We can try to figure out what this thing might be, how it might have gotten there, but the systems are just memorizing things. So that's a real limit\u2026\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0The same thing might happen with behavior. You try this out in Palo Alto, all the drivers are relaxed; you try it in New York, and you see a whole different style of driving. The system may not generalize well to a new style of driving\u2026 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You and I can use some reasoning about the world. If we see a parade, maybe we don't have a lot of data about parades, but we see the parade and we say, \"There're a\u00a0lot of people, so let's stop and wait a while.\" Maybe the car gets that, or maybe it gets confused by the mass of people and doesn't recognize it because it doesn't quite fit into its files for individual people...There's a huge problem in general with the whole approach of machine learning, which is that it relies on a training set and a test set, the test set being similar to the training set. Training is all the data that you've memorized, essentially, and the test set is what happens in the real world.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When you're using machine learning techniques, it very much depends on how similar the set of test data to the training data that I've seen before is.Snow and rain aren\u2019t quite as much as a problem as they were then, but edge cases have by no means gone away.  The degree to which you are safe in a driverless car still depends too much on the vagaries of data, and not enough on reasoning. (If that doesn\u2019t remind you of LLMs, you aren\u2019t paying attention.)\u00a7Yet the lust for getting this not yet-fully-baked technology continues unabated. Just last week the California Public Utilities Commission approved Cruise and Waymo, two of the biggest groups attempting to build self-driving cars, for operation 24/7, across all of San Francisco, given the companies far more leeway to test their cars.A few hours later, one well-known techno-optimist all but declared victory, posting on X, \u201cThey promised us self-driving cars, and all we got was self-driving cars, slightly late\u201d.Well, no, not exactly. To begin with, license to test the car is not the same thing as saying they work; it was a (mis)calculated bet by some bureaucrats, not a definitive, peer-reviewed scientific thumbs up. In fact, the truth is we don\u2019t actually have any truly self-driving cars yet. As Cade Metz explained to me a couple months ago on my podcast, Humans versus Machines, literally every \u201cself-driving vehicle\u201d on public roads has either a human safety driver on board, or some human somewhere watching remotely who can help the vehicle out when issues arises.And, it\u2019s not just that literally every proto-self-driving-car stills need a nanny. It\u2019s that they also still struggle (that\u2019s what the whole episode with Metz was about). And sure enough  increasing operations has led chaos. And it didn\u2019t take long.  One of my favorite colleagues in the field wrote to me on Monday, shortly after the CPUC decision, \u201cI am super confident this is going to be a &)@$ show\u201d.She was right. And it didn\u2019t take long to find out.\u00a7Less than a week in fact. Five days later, the The New York Times reads on one of my own litanies on AI Gone Wrong:Stuck in concrete?? Now there\u2019s a novel edge case. Even more hilarious than a Tesla running into a parked jet.No matter how much data these things are trained on, there\u2019s always something new. \u00a7\u00a0Another ten \u201cself-driving\u201d cars failed in the last week because they lost contact with mission control, and without it, they were lost, stalled right in the middle of a busy street:\u00a7\u00a0Driverless cars have been given every advantage in life: over $100 billion in funding, almost as much adulatory press as (the far more deserving) Taylor Swift, and, now, license to roam, despite all the known issues and the well-established reality that the unknown unknowns seemingly never end. I honestly don\u2019t know what the California Public Utilities Commission was thinking; none of the independent scientists I know follow these things would have endorsed the idea.Scaling up to driving everywhere all the time without a well-vetted serious, well-vetted solution to the edge case problem was insane; it was quite literally an accident (or series of accidents) waiting to happen.I hope some lessons have been learned.\u00a7And not just for driverless cars, but for mission-critical uses of machine learning in general. Edge cases are everywhere; they are in driving, they are in medicine, they there will be a zillion of them humanoid robots, if and when we roll them out. Anyone who thinks any of this is going to be easy is fooling themselves.In a different world, less driven by money, and more by a desire to build AI that we could trust, we might pause and ask a very specific question: have we discovered the right technology to address edge cases that pervade our messy really world? And if we haven\u2019t, shouldn\u2019t we stop hammering a square peg into a round hole, and shift our focus towards developing new methodologies for coping with the endless array of edge cases?If we don\u2019t, we are likely to see reprises of what we see now with driverless cars, in automated doctors, automated psychiatrists, all purpose virtual assistants, home robots, and more, probably for years to come.\u00a7\u00a0As a brief coda, I wrote this essay on an airplane, a 747-400 to be exact. The 747 has an autopilot, engaged for a very large fraction of the nine hour flight, but it has a human crew, too, and that\u2019s the way I like it, humans-in-the-loop. I wouldn\u2019t trust a self-driving plane, and I don\u2019t think any quasi-self-driving car has yet earned its stripes either.

Businesses may be at a disadvantage if they too don\u2019t use such systems, e.g., to counter adverse news, automatically. Elections may hinge on them. The killer app of AGI may be killing truth.The crux of it, reported in TheDebrief.org, is this:The initial efforts of the CounterCloud experiment focused on using ChatGPT to write counter articles against existing content on the internet. CounterCloud\u2019s AI would go out and find articles by specific publications, journalists, or keywords that CounterCloud is targeting. It would then scrape that content, and have an LLM like ChatGPT create counter articles [called Counter Tweets in the image below - GFM]. That content would then be published to the CounterCloud website, which is hosted on WordPress.In the sample below,  \u201cCounterCloud was given the task to counter pro-Russian and pro-Republican narratives from websites such as RT and Sputnik. It was ideologically aligned with a pro-American and pro-Democrat framework, so all content generated leans politically to those sides\u201d. It could of course be just as easily given the reverse task. The temptation for all sides to use these tools is likely to be overwhelming.sample of automatically-generated counter tweets\u00a7Some immediate thoughts:Automatic tools like these will surely accelerate the enshittification of the internet that I discussed yesterday.It\u2019s a powerful reminder that our existing laws are not sufficient to protect us from the full scope of harms that generative AI is beginning to enable . We ought to demand that any content like this that is automatically generated be labeled (no existing law does that) and watermarked (no existing law does that either) and, as I recently discussed in the Atlantic, we ought to demand that the wholesale generation of misinformation be punishable; there ought to be enforcement. At present wholesale misinformation is, so far as I know, not (except arguably in certain very restricted domains like securities fraud) illegal in the US.It highlights the inadequacy of the voluntary agreements such as the one that 7 tech companies recently made with The White House. Those agreements called for watermarking, but because they are voluntary, they do nothing to prevent bad actors from rolling their own automated misinformation software.Social media companies better watch out, too; they will be polluted in much the same way as the internet as a whole.An age in which nobody trusts anything may sound like a victory for critical thinking, but it has always been the precise goal of those who wish to flood the zone with shit; it\u2019s exactly according to the plan of the \u201cfirehose of propaganda model\u201d, oft associated with Putin and contemporary Russia.What we really need is AI that is smart enough to know when it is being used to spew falsehood. We have no such thing; building it would require a major reshaping of research directions, towards an AI based in facts and competent in reasoning, rather than just the powerful tools for text prediction that we have now.ShareGary Marcus, who has been warning for quite some time about automated misinformation, calling it AI\u2019s Jurassic Park moment, is even more concerned than before.

It\u2019s not just the internet, that\u2019s been infested; it\u2019s Amazon, too, as people are using GPT to create low-quality books:And even worse, Amazon is starting to be a receptacle for inaccurate and exploitative quickie histories of recent events:Adding to the chaos, the search engines are now sucking down each other\u2019s garbage, as in this blunder from Bard that turns out to have been nicked from ChatGPT, an example of what Ernest Davis and I long ago called the \u201cecho chamber effect\u201d:And of course LLMs are fully capable of make up truly terrible advice, too, like this disconcerting recipe from last week:And once they do make stuff up like that, that garbage will circulate, from one stochastic parrot to the next. \u00a7The close of my February essay seems even more pertinent now; forgive me for repeating it.Cesspools of automatically-generated fake websites, rather than ChatGPT search, may ultimately come to be the single biggest threat that Google ever faces. After all, if users are left sifting through sewers full of useless misinformation, the value of search would go to zero\u2014potentially killing the company.For the company that invented Transformers\u2014the major technical advance underlying the large language model revolution\u2014that would be a strange irony indeed.Postscript, two hours later:  No enumeration of internet excrement would be complete without this regularly updated list of bogus news sites, compiled by NewsGuard: https://www.newsguardtech.com/special-reports/ai-tracking-center/ \u2014 421 sites and counting, \u201coperating with little to no human oversight\u201d.

{"title": "What exactly are the economics of AI?", "link": "https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/what-exactly-are-the-economics-of", "date": "2023-08-14T19:29:00.606Z", "content": "Is the fever for Generative AI (the form of AI that is currently most popular) on track to be the tulip mania of the 2020s? As I argued yesterday, the whole thing could turn out to be a fad,  but it\u2019s still way too early too tell. Sometimes AI has hit it big. Google Search has made more money than almost any product in history, and it\u2019s powered by AI. Google Search has been powered by AI since the outset (when it included zero percent Generative AI) and continues to make a ton of money now, as bits of generative AI are presumably blended in. (Generative AI presumably helps the quality of results; I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s had a material impact on the bottom line.) Meta, too, has made an immense amount of money selling ads, and AI (though again not necessarily cutting-edge AI) has always been part of what allowed them to place those ads with precision. (As in the case of Alphabet and Google Search, it\u2019s hard to see from the outside whether Generative AI has had a material effect on Meta\u2019s profits).A few years ago there was a joke in Silicon Valley, anchored to some degree in reality, that if you had .ai in your startup\u2019s domain name you could add a zero to your valuation (100M instead of 10M, etc). Nowadays it feels like it could be two zeros, especially if you claim to be using Generative AI. But of course just because something is powered by AI doesn\u2019t mean it will make truckloads of money. And so far Generative AI hasn\u2019t. Maybe hundreds of millions, probably not billions. certainly not hundreds of billions. A rumor that\u2019s been circulating the internet in the last few days went so far as to suggest that OpenAI could even face bankruptcy, possibly as soon as 2024, per a tweet  from Rowan Cheung.that got deleted almost as quickly as it got posted.\u00a7Should we believe the rumor?Driverless cars are powered by AI, but so far the money that has gone into them, on  order of $100 billion dollars, vastly exceeds the actual revenue that has come out of them.  (Perhaps several billion dollars, from driver assist software sold to car manufacturers, AutoPilot upcharges on Tesla, a little bit from paying rides in experimental programs, etc). Cheung\u2019s Tweet (deleted without explanation) ultimately derives from an analysis by Mohit Pandey at Analytics India Magazine.Pandey\u2019s basic premise was that OpenAI is spending about $700,000/day, and not making all that much revenue. A December estimate that the company reportedly provided was $200 million for 2023, with a rosy prediction of $2 billion for 2024. As Pandey reported, however, the month by month website visit data, however, no longer seem to fit with exponential growth:That said, I don\u2019t think OpenAI is actually in any kind of imminent danger, but nor do I think they are out of the woods.  Here are a bunch of considerations in either direction, partly drawn from a fun conversation I had earlier today with the VC and tech writer Om Malik:Reasons why OpenAI, and generative AI, might still do well financially:Coding is a solid use case that will continue to keep generative AI in the limelight for a long time. Programmers will never go back.As Malik points out, OpenAI is probably already making nearly enough money to cover costs, and they have plenty in the bank; imminent bankruptcy is a real stretch. Most of the costs are GPU server time that Microsoft could easily provide to OpenAI with more server time in exchange for greater control. (I would not be at all surprised to this happen). I am doubtful that Microsoft would let OpenAI go under anytime soon, given the optics, and impact on their own stock price.LLMs will probably get cheaper to operate over time, both as the hardware required inevitably gets cheaper, and as people figure out how to make them more efficient.Some use case that provided significant profits could still be discovered or perfected. (For example, ChatGPT-style search seems vary shaky now but could improve if new discoveries are made).Reasons why OpenAI, and generative AI, might struggle financially:Current revenue appears modest, perhaps roughly in the ballpark of operating costs, but not far beyond those costs. With the exception of Chat-style search, which doesn\u2019t (yet?) work well,  no killer app has yet emerged. Investors will not be infinitely patient. For some use cases (e.g. writing efficient but bland copy), the novelty might already be wearing off. Users may or may not maintain long-term subscriptions. Most of the basic technology is well-understood, and to a large degree readily copyable. It\u2019s not clear that any commercial company (eg OpenAI) has a durable moat to keep competitors out.The underlying technology\u2014often referred to as Foundation Models, because systems are fine-tuned on top of large pretrained (foundation) model\u2014is deeply unstable and thus difficult to engineer into reliable products. I plan to write more about this soon, but the basic gist is that you can never really predict for any given question whether a large language model will give you a correct answer, We now know that answers can even change from one month to the next\u2014which makes third-party engineering of large language models into complex systems a huge uphill struggle. In some mission-critical cases that engineering challenge may be insuperable.Much of the current enthusiasm if fueled by enthusiasm; bubbles beget bubbles \u2026 until they don\u2019t. If some people get off the bus, and valuations begin to drop a little, that could launch a potent negative feedback spiral, sparking a sudden  deceleration in values that heretofore had been rapidly accelerating. A lot of talent and investors might move on to a new set of shiny things, fleeing generative AI as quickly as some of the same people not long ago fled crypto.ConclusionsMany of my essays end with a high degree of certainty; this one doesn\u2019t. We just don\u2019t really know how much gold lies at the end of this particular rainbow.. AI is not a magical economic engine; it works brilliantly in some use cases (such as selling ads,  helping coders write code faster, playing classic board games) but in many others it simply isn\u2019t reliable enough (e.g., truly autonomous driverless cars, medical diagnosis, ChatGPT-style search). The astronomical valuations for Generative AI companies might be justified, but might well not be. Thus far, the valuations seem to be predicated on  hopes and dreams, without really factoring in the serious engineering risks.It\u2019s not a house of cards, but the financial foundation of so-called Foundation Models is hardly as robust as it seems.Caveat emptor.ShareGary Marcus, well known for his recent testimony on AI oversight at the US Senate, recently co-founded the Center for the Advancement of Trustworthy AI, and in 2019 wrote a book with Ernest Davis about getting to a thriving world with AI we can trust. He still desperately hopes we can get there. Subscribe"}

Valuations for many companies are in the billions, coverage in the news is literally constant; it\u2019s all anyone can talk about from Silicon Valley to Washington DC to Geneva.But, to begin with, the revenue isn\u2019t there yet, and might never come. The valuations anticipate trillion dollar markets, but the actual current revenues from generative AI are rumored to be in the hundreds of millions. Those revenues genuinely could grow by 1000x, but that\u2019s mighty speculative. We shouldn\u2019t simply assume it. Most of the revenue so far seems to derive from two sources, writing semi-automatic code (programmers love using generative tools as assistants) and writing text. I think coders will remain happy with generative AI assistance; its autocomplete nature is fabulous for their line of work, and they have the training to detect and fix the not-infrequent errors. And undergrads will continue to use generative AI, but their pockets aren\u2019t deep (most likely they will turn to open source competitors).Other potential paying customers may lose heart quickly. This morning the influential venture capitalist Benedict Evans raised this in a series of posts on X (formerly known as Twitter):My friends who tried to use ChatGPT to answer search queries to help with academic research have faced similar disillusionment. A lawyer who used ChatGPT for legal research was excoriated by a judge, and basically had to promise, in writing, never to do so again in an unsupervised way. A few weeks ago, a news report suggested that GPT use might be falling off.If Evans\u2019 experience is a canary in a coal mine, the whole generative AI field, at least at current valuations, could come to a fairly swift end. Coders would continue to use it, and marketers who have to write a lot of copy to promote their products in order to increase search engine rankings would, too. But neither coding nor high-speed, mediocre quality copy-writing are remotely enough to maintain current valuation dreams. Even OpenAI could have a hard time following through on its $29 billion valuation; competing startups valued in the low billions might well eventually collapse, if year after year they manage only tens or hundreds of millions in revenue. Microsoft, up for the year by nearly half, perhaps largely on the promise of generative AI, might see a stock slump; NVIDIA skyrocketing even more, might also fall. Roger McNamee, an early pioneer in venture investing in software, and I were discussing this the other day. Perhaps the only use case that really seemed compelling to either of us economically was search (e.g., using Bing powered by ChatGPT instead of Google Search) \u2014 but the technical problems there are immense; there is no reason to think that the hallucination problem will be solved soon. If it isn\u2019t, the bubble could easily burst. \u00a7But what has me worried right now is not just the possibility that the whole generative AI economy\u2014still based more on promise than actual commercial use\u2014could see a massive, gut-wrenching correction, but that we are building our entire global and national policy on the premise that generative AI will be world-changing in ways that may in hindsight turn out to have been unrealistic.On the global front, the Biden administration has both limited access to high-end hardware chips that are (currently) essential for generative AI, and limited investment in China; China\u2019s not exactly being warm towards global cooperation either. Tensions are extremely high, and a lot of it to revolve around dreams about who might \u201cwin the AI war.\u201d But what if it the winner was nobody, at least not any time soon? On the national front, regulation that might protect consumers (e.g., around privacy, reducing bias, demanding transparency in data, combatting misinformation, etc), is being slowed by a countervailing pressure to make sure that US generative AI develops as quickly as possible. We might not get the consumer protections we need, because we are trying to foster something that may not grow as expected. I am not saying anyone\u2019s particular policies are wrong, but if the premise that generative AI is going to be bigger than fire and electricity turns out to be mistaken, or at least doesn\u2019t bear out in the next decade, it\u2019s certainly possible that we could wind up with what in hindsight is a lot of needless extra tension with China, possibly even a war in Taiwan, over a mirage, along with a social-media level fiasco in which consumers are exploited in news, and misinformation rules the day because governments were afraid to clamp down hard enough. It\u2019s hard to put odds on any of this, but it\u2019s a sobering thought, and one that I hope will get some consideration both in Washington and Beijing.\u00a7In my mind, the fundamental error that almost everyone is making is in believing that Generative AI is tantamount to AGI (general purpose artficial intelligence, as smart and resourceful as humans if not more so).Everybody in industry would probably like you to believe that AGI is imminent. It stokes their narrative of inevitability, and it drives their stock prices and startup valuations. Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, recently projected that we will have AGI in 2-3 years. Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind has also made projections of near-term AGI.I seriously doubt it. We have not one, but many, serious, unsolved problems at the core of generative AI \u2014 ranging from their tendency to confabulate (hallucinate) false information, to their inability to reliably interface with external tools like Wolfram Alpha, to the instability from month to month (which makes them poor candidates for engineering use in larger systems). And, reality check, we have no concrete reason, other than sheer technoptimism, for thinking that solutions to any of these problems is imminent. \u201cScaling\u201d systems by making them larger has helped in some ways, but not others; we still really cannot guarantee that any given system will be honest, harmless, or helpful, rather than sycophantic, dishonest, toxic or biased. And AI researchers have been working on these problems for years. It\u2019s foolish to imagine that such challenging problems will all suddenly be solved. I\u2019ve been griping about hallucination errors for 22 years; people keep promising the solution is nigh, and it never happens. The technology we have now is built on autocompletion, not factuality.For a while this concern fell on deaf ears; but some tech leaders finally seem to be getting the message. Witness this story in Fortune just a few days ago:If hallucinations aren\u2019t fixable, generative AI probably isn\u2019t going to make a trillion dollars a year. And if it probably isn\u2019t going to make a trillion dollars a year, it probably isn\u2019t going to have the impact people seem to be expecting. And if it isn\u2019t going to have that impact, maybe we should not be building our world around the premise that it is.Gary Marcus, well known for his recent testimony on AI oversight at the US Senate, recently co-founded the Center for the Advancement of Trustworthy AI, and in 2019 wrote a book with Ernest Davis about getting to a thriving world with AI we can trust.

The urgency for a coherent, international plan to regulate AI has been widely recognized, and some world leaders have come out favoring the idea.But we all know that crafting legislation, let alone international agreements, is wicked hard, and can often take many years. Many of us have also become worried about the possibility of regulatory capture, and whether shrewd executives at the major tech companies might induce governments to alight on regulation that ultimately does more harm than good, keeping out smaller players, and entrenching Big Tech\u2019s own status, while doing little to address the underlying risks, such as around misinformation and cybercrime.Throughout the time in which I have been advocating for international AI governance, I have emphasized the need to have scientists and civil society more generally at the table. The photo ops I have seen from governments so far don\u2019t give me huge confidence that that will happen, at least not in a sufficiently empowered way. Which has gotten me to thinking. Is there a way that a third party - philanthropists - could catalyze something something that was both faster and more independent than what governments working together with tech companies might do on their own?\u00a7For the last two months, I along with my collaborators Anka Reuel (Stanford) and Karen Bakker (UBC/Harvard), I have been working to develop an alternative that we are calling \u201cgovernance-in-a-box\u201d; yesterday at my keynote at the AI for Good Global Summit in Geneva we announced that we are launching CATAI - the Center for The Advancement of Trustworthy AI, and and announced our collaboration with our first philanthropic partner in this adventure, Omidyar Network. The response was amazing; we expect that will have other partnerships to announce before long. The idea of governance-in-box, in a nutshell, is to create turnkey tools, training, consulting, and best practices for AI regulation. Ideally, we would give that package away for minimal cost (supported in part by philanthropy) to countries that lack the expertise to develop their own regulatory regimes for AI, presumably customizable by their individual needs.The virtue in this is twofold: first, there is safety in numbers. If a large number of countries can alight on common procedures and practices, the big tech companies will be obliged to take those procedures and practices seriously; what\u2019s more, it\u2019s actually in the interest of the individual companies to have common standards for interoperability, and for climate change reasons as well (nobody should want to train 193 models for 193 countries, with all the emissions thar are associated with each training or retraining).Second, there is speed; virtually everyone recognizes that large language models carry risks as well as opportunities, and that there is an urgent need to start to address these risks. In our new organization - the Center for the Advancement of Trustworthy AI, we can move swiftly. If we can produce the right package of tools and expertise for auditing, prerelease examination, and so on, address questions of bias, reliability, misinformation and so forth, working together of course with existing agencies that have been aiming to craft related standards, adoption may be swift. The general principles around transparency, privacy, and accountability are well known; our hope is to help countries to put teeth into those expectations.We certainly don\u2019t see this approach as in fundamental conflict with governments building their own frameworks. But we hope that it can  contribute to\u2013 and even catalyze \u2013 a collective endeavor in which government will play in important role, and in which companies will step up as well.Gary Marcus (@garymarcus), scientist, bestselling author, and entrepreneur, deeply concerned about current AI but really hoping that we might do better.

I was thrilled by what I saw of the Senate that day: genuine interest, and genuine humility. Senators acknowledged that they were too slow to figure out what do about social media, that the  moves were made then, and that there was now a sense of urgency. I am profoundly grateful to Senator Blumenthal\u2019s office for allowing me to participate, and tremendously heartened that there was far more bipartisan consensus around regulation that I had anticipated. Things have moved in a positive direction since then. But we haven\u2019t landed the plane yet.\u00a7Just a few weeks earlier, I had been writing in this Substack and in the Economist (with Anka Reuel), about the need for an international agency for AI. To my great surprise, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told me before the proceedings began that he was supportive of the idea. Taken off guard, I shot back,, \u201cterrific, you should tell the Senate\u201d, never expecting that he would. To my amazement, he did, interjecting, after I raised the notion of global AI, that he wanted  to echo support for what Mr. Marcus said.\u201dThings have in many ways moved quickly since then, far faster than I might have ever dreamed. In 2017, I proposed a CERN for AI, in the New York Times, to relatively little response. This time, things (at least nominally) are moving at breakneck speed. Earlier this weekn. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak explicitly called  for a CERN for AI as well something like an IAEA for AI, all very much in line with what I and others have hoped for.  Earlier today President Biden and Prime Minster Sunak agreed today, publicly, \u201cto work together on A.I. safety\u201dAll that is incredibly gratifying. And yet \u2026 I am still worried. Really, really worried.\u00a7What I am worried about is regulatory capture; governments making rules that entrench the incumbents whilst doing too little for humanity. The realistic possibility of this scenario was captured viscerally in a sharp tweet from earlier today, from British technology expert Rachel Coldicutt: I had similar pit-of-my-stomach feeling in May after the VP Kamala Harris met with some tech executives, with scientists scarcely mentioned: \u00a7Putting it bluntly: if we have the right regulation; things could go well. If we have the wrong regulation, things could badly. If big tech writes the rules, without outside input, we are unlikely to wind up with the right rules.In a talk I gave earlier today to the IMF, I painted two scenarios, one positive, one negative:\u00a7We still have agency here; we can still, I think, build a very positive AI future. But much depends on how much the government stands up to big tech, and a lot of that depends on having independent voices \u2013 scientists, ethicists, and representatives of civil society \u2013 at the table. Press releases and photo opportunities that highlight governments hanging out with the tech moguls they seek to regulate, without independent voices in the room, send entirely the wrong message.The rubber meets the road in implementation. We have, for example, Microsoft declaring right now that transparency and safety are key. But their current, actual products are definitely not transparent, and at least in some ways, demonstrably not safe. Bing relies on GPT-4, and we (eg, in the scientific community) don\u2019t have access to how GPT-4 works, and we don\u2019t have access to what data its trained on (vital, since we know that systems can bias eg political thought and hiring decisions based on those undisclosed data) \u2014 that\u2019s about as far away from transparency as we could be. We also know, for example, that Bing has defamed people, and it has misread articles as saying the opposite of what they actually say, in service of doing so. Recommending Kevin Roose get a divorce wasn\u2019t exactly competent, either. Meanwhile, ChatGPT plugins (produced by OpenAI, which they have a close tie with) open a wide range of security problems: those plugins can access the internet, read and write files, and impersonate people (e.g., to phish for credentials), all alarms to any security professional.  I don\u2019t see any reason to think these plugins are in fact safe. (They are far less sandboxed and less rigorously controlled than Apple app store apps.)This is where the government needs to step up and say \u201ctransparency and safety are indeed requirements; you\u2019ve flouted them; we won\u2019t let you do that anymore.\u201dWe don\u2019t need more photo opportunities, we need regulation \u2013 with teeth.\u00a7More broadly, at an absolute minimum governments need to establish an approval process for any AI that deployed at large scale, showing that the benefits outweigh the risks, and to mandate post-release auditing - by independent outsiders - of any large-scale deployments. Goverments should demand that systems only use copyrighted content from content providers that opt-in, and that all machine-generated content be labeled as such.  And governments need to make sure that there are strong liability laws in place, to ensure that if the big tech companies cause harm with their products, they be held responsible.Letting the companies set the rules on their own is unlikely to get us any of these places.\u00a7In the aftermath of the Senate hearings, a popular sport is to ask, \u201cis Sam Altman sincere, when he has asked for government regulation of AI?\u201dA lot of people doubted him; having sat three feet away from him, throughout the testimony, and watched his body language, I actually think that he is at least in part sincere, that it is not just a ploy to keep the incumbents in and small competitors out, that he is genuinely worried about the risks (ranging from misinformation, to serious physical harm to humanity).  I said as much to the Senate, for what it\u2019s worth.But it doesn\u2019t matter whether Sam is sincere or not. He is not the only actor in this play; Microsoft, for example, has access, as I understand it, according to rumor, to all of OpenAI\u2019s models, and can do as they please with them; if Sam is worried, but Nadella wants to race forward, Nadella has that right. Nadella has said he wants to make Google dance, and he has.What really matters is what governments around the world come up with by way of regulation. We would never leave the pharmaceutical industry to entirely self-regulate itself, and we shouldn\u2019t leave AI to do so, either.  It doesn\u2019t matter what Microsoft or OpenAI or Google says. It matters what the government says. Either they stand up to Big Tech, or they don\u2019t; the fate of humanity may very well rest on the balance.Gary Marcus (@garymarcus), scientist, bestselling author, and entrepreneur, deeply concerned about current AI but really hoping that we might do better.

He thinks neural networks \u201cunderstand\u201d the world; I think they do not.  He probably thinks we are closer to AGI (artificial general intelligence) than I do.But we are both really, deeply worried about AI, and seem to be converging on a common idea about what to do about it. Most of our concerns are shared. I\u2019ve been writing with urgency about my concerns about the contributions of large language models misinformation, and my concerns about how bad actors might misuse AI, and in my essay AI risk \u2260 AGI risk, argued that we should worry about both near-term and long-term risks. In endorsing the \u201cpause letter\u201d (despite expressing some concerns about the details), I was saying we need to slow down, and to focus on the kind of research that the pause letter emphasized, viz work on making sure that AI systems would be trustworthy and reliable. (This was also the major thrust of my 2019 book with Ernest Davis, which was subtitled Building AI We Can Trust; the point of the book was that current approaches were not in fact getting us to such trust.)Hinton has heretofore been fairly quiet about AI risk, aside from a hint at a recent CBS News interview in March, in which he said rather cryptically that it was \u201cnot inconceivable\u201d that AI could wipe out humanity. In the last few day he left Google, and he spoke more freely with Cade Metz, in a must-read article at The New York Times.  Metz reports that Hinton expressed worries about misinformation (\u201cHis immediate concern is that the internet will be flooded with false photos, videos and text, and the average person will \u201cnot be able to know what is true anymore.\u201d), misuse of AI  (\u201cIt is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors from using it for bad things\u201d), and the difficulty in controlling unpredictable machines (\u201che is worried that future versions of the technology pose a threat to humanity because they often learn unexpected behavior from the vast amounts of data they analyze\u201d). I agree with every word. And independently made each of these points a little less than two weeks ago, when I spoke at TED. (Rumor has it that my talk will be released in the next couple weeks.)The question is what we should do about it.\u00a7 At TED, and in companion op-ed that I co-wrote in the Economist, I urged for the formation of an International Agency for AI:An archived version of this essay can be found hereWe called for the immediate development of a global, neutral, non-profit International Agency for ai (iaai), with guidance and buy-in from governments, large technology companies, non-profits, academia and society at large, aimed at collaboratively finding governance and technical solutions to promote safe, secure and peaceful ai technologiesThe thing that struck me the most about Hinton\u2019s interview is that he has converged on his own to a very similar place. Quoting Metz in the Times:. The best hope is for the world\u2019s leading scientists to collaborate on ways of controlling the technology. \u201cI don\u2019t think they should scale this up more until they have understood whether they can control it,\u201d he saidLet\u2019s get on it.  \u00a7I have spent all my time since TED gathering a crew of interested collaborators, speaking to various leaders in government, business, and science, and inviting community input.

What if instead the world were  facing one of the great multi-layered ironies in history? Some thoughts, premises numbered for your convenience (such that people respond with precision in the comments).Regulation is NOT always bad for technology, e.g., regulation around the environmental impact of cars has spurred advances in electric cars; rising fuel standards have had a positive impact as well. A 1966 US Army restriction on fixed-wing aircraft for airlifts presumably inspired innovation in helicopters, etc. GPT-5 will not bring us to AGI. I see it; Yann LeCun sees it; now even Sam Altman sees it. Getting GPT-5 first will therefore not directly bring China or US to AGI first, per Premise 2.Truthfulness is one of the major gaps in current systems, as evidenced by hallucinations, weird defamatory accusations etc. Another major challenge lies in forcing LLMs to consistently align with (any) set of ethical values.Neurosymbolic AI might offer a better way of resolving these issues, since it traffics in facts and explicit reasoning, but neurosymbolic AI is out of fashion, and neither well-developed nor strongly supported by the VC world.At present, however, there is no legal requirement in the west that AI companies resolve the truthfulness or alignment issues. Market pressures (e.g. on search) may or may not suffice. There is a fair amount of resistance to any substantive regulation in the US, particularly in the (powerful) libertarian strands of the tech community, e.g. remarks like \u201cthe whole point of regulation is to slow innovation\u201d. (To me, this seems like an overgeneralization from the true statement some regulation is bad to the untrue statement all regulation is bad.)China\u2019s leaders are largely free to impose whatever regulatory regime they like, and seem to keen impose strong regulatory requirementsOne of those requirements is for, putting it politely, strong alignment with Communist Party perspectives; less politely, we are talking about censorship. Bots that don\u2019t toe the party line will be banned. This regulation may force the Chinese tech community to solve a version of the alignment problem, perhaps initially by using tons of underpaid manual labour but ultimately by investing in neurosymbolic AI.Investments in that problem could thus spur China to leapfrog the West in AI.In short, the commercial pressure of committing to mandatory censorship of LLMs could induce Chinese tech companies to overtake their Western counterparts in the development of AGI; more regulation might spark more innovation, and something that is anathema to Western observers (including myself) might be the ironic catalyst.How might we in the West counter all that? In part by carefully choosing the right innovation-encouraging regulations of our own. My best candidate? Placing very high standards around truth, with strong penalties for LLM-induced defamation and the wholesale spread of harmful misinformation. As Justice Gorsuch seem to hint recently, Section 230 should not protect platforms from misinformation that their own tools generate.  Regulations that spur greater accuracy might actually spur greater innovation.If AGI is to emerge at all, I hope that it will emerge from the noble act of trying to make a better world, and not as an accidental byproduct of censorship and propaganda. If getting to the right place requires regulation, rather than just the kindness of corporations with a nominal attachment to \u201cresponsible AI\u201d, so be it.

{"title": "Stop Treating AI Models Like People", "link": "https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/stop-treating-ai-models-like-people", "date": "2023-04-17T22:26:00.851Z", "content": "By Sasha Luccioni and Gary Marcus The ELIZA effect is still with us, more than half a century laterFor the last few months, people have had endless \u201cconversations\u201d with\u00a0 chatbots like GPT-4 and Bard, asking these systems whether climate change is real, how to get people to fall in love with them, and even their plans for AI-powered world domination. This is apparently done by operating under the assumption that these system have genuine beliefs, and the capacity to teach themselves, as in this Tweet from the US Senator Chris Murphy:In the language of cognitive psychology, all of this is \u201coverattribution\u201d, ascribing a kind of mental life to these machines that simply isn\u2019t there, like when many years ago people thought that Furbies were learning language, when in reality\u00a0the  unfolding of abilities\u00a0 was pre-programmed. As most experts realize, the reality is that current AI doesn\u2019t \u201cdecide to teach itself\u201d, or even have consistent beliefs. One minute the string of words that it generates may tell you that it understands language.And another it may say the opposite.There is no there there, no homunculus inside the box, no inner agent with thoughts about the world, not even long-term memory. The AI systems that power these chatbots are simply systems (technically known as \u201clanguage models\u201d because they emulate (model) the statistical structure of language) that compute probabilities of word sequences, without any deep or human-like comprehension of what they say. Yet the urge to personify these systems is, for many people, irresistible, an extension of the same impulse that makes see a face on the Moon or attributing agency and emotions to two triangles \u201cchasing\u201d each other around a screen. Everyone in the AI community is aware of this, and yet even experts are occasionally tempted to anthropomorphism, as deep learning pioneer Geoffrey Hinton\u2019 recently tweeted that \u201cReinforcement Learning by Human Feedback is just parenting for a supernaturally precocious child.\u201d\u00a0 Doing so can be cute, but also fundamentally misleading, and even dangerous.The fact that people might over attribute intelligence to AI system has been known for a long time, at least back to ELIZA, a computer program from the 1960s that was able to have faux-psychiatric conversations with humans by using a pattern matching approach, giving users the impression that the program truly understood them. What we are seeing now is simply an extension of the same \u201cELIZA effect\u201d, 60 years later, where humans are continuing to project human qualities like emotions and understanding onto machines that lack them. With technology more and more able to emulate human responses based on larger and larger samples of text (and \u201creinforcement learning\u201d from humans who instruct the machines), the problem has grown even more pernicious. In one instance, someone interacted with a bot as if it were somewhere between a lover and therapist and ultimately committed suicide; causality is hard to establish, but the widow saw that interaction as having played an important role; the risk of overattribution in a vulnerable patient is serious.\u00a0\u00a0As tempting as it is, we have to stop treating AI models like people. When we do so, we amplify the hype around AI, and lead people into thinking that these machines are trustworthy oracles capable of manipulation or decision-making, which they are not. As anyone who has used these systems to generate a biography is aware of, they are prone to simply making things up; treating them as intelligent agents means that people can develop unsound emotional relationships, treat unsound medical advice as more worthy than it is, and so forth. It\u2019s also silly to ask these sorts of models for questions about themselves; as the mutually contradictory examples above make clear, they don\u2019t actually \u201cknow\u201d; they are just generating different word strings on different occasions, with no guarantee of anything.) The more false agency people ascribe to them, the more they can be exploited, suckered in by harmful applications like catfishing and fraud, as well as more subtly harmful applications like chatbot-assisted therapy or flawed financial advice. What we need is for the public to learn that human-sounding speech isn\u2019t actually necessarily human anymore; caveat emptor. We also need new technical tools, like watermarks and generated content detectors, to help distinguish human- and machine-generated content, and policy measures to limit how and where AI models can be used.Educating people to overcome the overattribution bias will be a vital step; we can\u2019t have senators and members of the AI community making the problem worse. It is crucial to retain a healthy skepticism towards these technologies, since they are very new, constantly evolving, and under-tested. Yes, they can generate cool haikus and well-written prose, but they also constantly spew misinformation (even about themselves), and cannot be trusted when it comes to answering questions about real-world events and phenomena, let alone to provide sound advice about mental health or marriage counseling.\u00a0\u00a0Treat them as fun toys, if you like, but don\u2019t treat them as friends.Dr. Sasha Luccioni is a Researcher and Climate Lead at Hugging Face, where she studies the ethical and societal impacts of AI models and datasets.

Worse, it\u2019s popular enough to become a potential menace.But a lot of other people are scared for a different reason: they imagine that GPT-5 will be wholly different from GPT-4, not some reliability-and-truth-challenged bull in a china shop, but a full-blown artificial general intelligence (AGI).That particular fear seems to drive a lot of the resistance to the pause proposal. For example a great many people fear that if we were to pause GPT-5 (but continue other research) that China would somehow leapfrog ahead of us, \u201cyou go to sleep with China six months ahead of the US, and wake up the next morning with China having fusion, nanotech, and starships.\u201dAGI really could disrupt the world. But GPT-5 is not going to do any of that; it\u2019s not going to be smart enough to revolutionize fusion; it\u2019s not going to be smart enough to revolutionize nanotech, and starships most definitely aren\u2019t going to be here in 2024. GPT-4 can\u2019t even play a good game of chess (it\u2019s about as good as chess computers from 1978). GPT-5 is not going to be magic. It will not give China, the US, or anyone else interstellar starships; it will not give anyone an insuperable military advantage. It might be on the nice-to-have list; it will not mark the mythical singularity. \u00a7A safe bet is that GPT-5 will be a lot like GPT-4, and do the same kinds of things and have the same kinds of flaws, but be somewhat better. It will be even better than GPT-4 at creating convincing sounding prose. (Not one of my predictions about GPT-4 proved to be incorrect; every flaw I predicted would persist persisted.)But GPT\u2019s on their own don\u2019t do scientific discovery. That\u2019s never been their forte. Their forte has been and always will be making shit up; they can\u2019t for the life of them (speaking metaphorically of course) check facts. They are more like late-night bullshitters than high-functioning scientists who would try to validate what they say with data and discover original things.  GPT\u2019s regurgitate ideas; they don\u2019t invent them. \u00a7Some form of AI may eventually do everything people are imagining, revolutionizing science and technology and so on, but LLMs will be at most only a tiny part of whatever as-yet-uninvented technology does that. What\u2019s happening now, in my view, is that people are wildly overattributing an intelligence to GPT-4 that isn\u2019t there, and then scaling up that further into something that is some kind of total fantasy about GPT-5.A lot of those fantasies get started when people don\u2019t really understand what\u2019s happening with GPT-4; over and over they misattribute occasionally startling feats of text manipulation over vast corpora for real understanding. This bit the other day from Eliezer Yudkowsky is pretty typical: At this time, Substack can\u2019t properly display long tweets; the original is here: If GPT-4 actually understood the instructions, in a repeatable and robust way, I would have to reevaluate a lot of my priors, too.But as ever, the replicability matters. And very little of what GPT-4 does is fully replicable. Sometimes summarization (aka compression) works (super cool!) and sometimes it doesn\u2019t, as many were quick to point out:Riley Goodside @goodside@ESYudkowsky I'm not seeing why this is impressive. Reconstruction in the OP seems not great and within the ability of a human to guess toward \u2014 last sentence in particular is very different. \n\nHere's an example with similar instructions where it just makes stuff up (2 diff sessions): 9:26 AM \u2219 Apr 5, 202395Likes2RetweetsTim Scarfe piled on, too.Machine Learning Street Talk @MLStreetTalk@ESYudkowsky Seemed interesting, tried it on a BBC news article and it almost totally failed - if anything proving the opposite i.e. it didn't understand much @GaryMarcus 10:53 AM \u2219 Apr 5, 2023Machine Learning Street Talk @MLStreetTalk@ESYudkowsky @GaryMarcus \"Peter Murrell, 58, is being questioned after being taken into police custody on Wednesday morning.\" became \"58 people arrested\" !!10:55 AM \u2219 Apr 5, 2023The other  thing Yudkowsky fell for is anecdotal data.

You can\u2019t for example use GPT as a reliable data processor, it won\u2019t drive cars reliably, and it\u2019s not going to be the right tool for tracking air forces in flight. Maybe if China optimize its search engines faster? Make quicker error ridden intelligence reports? Assuming the presumed advantage is military-related I still don\u2019t see it. The best answer I got was from a friend that does some work with the defense department; if GPT-5 was good at summarizing lots of videos fast, that would be great. But (a) that\u2019s totally speculative (video is way harder than text, in many ways, and may be quite costly computationally to do at scale) and (b) summarization gets back to where we started; GPT-4 is ok at summarizing, but not sure how much we ought trust it in mission critical applications. Perhaps the deepest challenge of all is one pointed out by the eminent ASU AI Professor Subbarao Kambhampati the other day, in a long thread I highly recommend: GPT\u2019s still have no idea how to plan; in almost any military scenario you might imagine, that\u2019s curtains:Subbarao Kambhampati (\u0c15\u0c02\u0c2d\u0c02\u0c2a\u0c3e\u0c1f\u0c3f \u0c38\u0c41\u0c2c\u0c4d\u0c2c\u0c3e\u0c30\u0c3e\u0c35\u0c41) @rao2zAfraid of #GPT4 going rogue and killing y'all?

But imagining that it will fundamentally transform the world into some sort of new AGI regime sometime in Q4 2023\u2014for China or the US-still seems like a fantasy to me. We in the West should definitely be concerned about whether China is going to catch up over the next decade. But basing our AI policies around fantasies doesn\u2019t seem like a particularly good idea. We should be super worried about how large language models, which are very difficult to steer, are changing our world, but the immediate transition to a singularity is one worry we can postpone.None of this is to say, though, we shouldn\u2019t be worried about China. Anecdotally, I just had a very smart and perfectly fluent reporter there, knowledgeable about my research, email me 17 deep, thoughtful questions on both policy and technical questions that go way beyond what typical Western reporters ask, pushing hard to find out what lies behind the latest shiny things. That rarely happens in the US, where questions tend to be tied more strictly to the current news cycle.  If China wins the AI war it will be partly because of data, partly because of choices about how to allocate resources, and partly because they ultimately do a better job educating their citizens and become the  first to invent something new, and not because they scale up the exciting but rickety contraption that\u2019s currently obsessing the West.SubscribeGary Marcus (@garymarcus), scientist, bestselling author, and entrepreneur, is deeply, deeply concerned about current AI but really hoping that we might do better.Watch for his new podcast, Humans versus Machines, debuting April 25th, wherever you get your podcasts.Share"}
{"title": "The first known chatbot associated death", "link": "https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/the-first-known-chatbot-associated", "date": "2023-04-04T19:04:41.927Z", "content": "Excerpt from my December 2022 essay, The Dark Risk of Large Language ModelsI wrote the above passage in August of 2022, for WIRED\u2019s 2023 prediction list which was published in December of 2022. Last week we saw the first report of a suicide in which a chatbot was (arguably) involved. A member of the Belgian government, the Secretary of State for Digitalisation, Mathieu Michel, was quoted as saying, \"I am particularly struck by this family's tragedy. What has happened is a serious precedent that needs to be taken very seriously\u201d, adding \u201cWith the popularisation of ChatGPT, the general public has discovered the potential of artificial intelligence in our lives like never before. While the possibilities are endless, the danger of using it is also a reality that has to be considered.\" What actually happened has been the subject of some discussion, not always anchored in facts. In response to a number of queries I\u2019ve received about the situation, I have written an FAQ. (Advisory warning, I will go into some detail about what happened; if you are feeling sensitive, feel free to skip this essay.)What are the basic facts? A person in Belgium who had been interacting with a chatbot over a period of months committed suicide not long after chatting with the chatbot. Both the widow and the psychiatrist/psychologist felt that the chatbot was partly responsible. The Chatbot involved was GPT-J, not GPT-3 or ChatGPT (contra some news headlines that were erroneous).Can causality be fully established? No. As I anticipated, causality is murky. And events like these generally have multiple causes both proximal and distal; there is no way to know for sure. But there\u2019s some reason to think the chatbot may have contributed, as discussed below.Do you think that the chatbot was wholly responsible? Certainly not. The patient was clearly already vulnerable. Then what is your concern? Vulnerable patients shouldn\u2019t be talking to chatbots that aren\u2019t competent for this situation, and too much of the discussion in the media have made chatbots sound more intelligent and even more friendly than they are. An immense segment of society is now taking the outputs of large language models seriously, and there is risk in that.What evidence suggests that the chatbot might in some ways be involved? Among other things, the widow\u2019s remarks (\u201cWithout these six weeks of intense exchanges with the chatbot Eliza, would Pierre have ended his life? No! Without Eliza, he would still be here. I am convinced of it.\u201d,  and the transcript of the final interaction, reported below. That dialog strikes me as incompetent, and not something any competent psychiatrist or psychologist would ever directly ask. Any competent professional might have recognized from the rest of the dialog that there was clear and imminent risk at that moment, and urged immediate care. Can you share the transcript? I have, at the bottom. The original was in French; I asked a French-speaking journalist to translate it for me and am pasting the translation below. I don\u2019t think that any human therapist ever would have handled the conversation in this way. Please read it with caution, or simply take my word that it is disturbing, and skip it. Every human I know feels down from time to time; there is no shame in that. If this is one of those moments for you, please find a friend (not a chatbot!) or a human professional to talk to.What gives me any right to talk about this? Aside from the fact that I predicted this specific scenario, I was once upon a time a (full) Professor of Psychology at NYU. I am not a clinical psychologist, but have spoken with many leading experts in the field, gone to numerous lectures, etc. This does not make me expert in clinical psychology, but I am not coming from left field, either.Why are you writing about this now, and going into further detail? Two reasons, first, because I believe that more incidents like this will happen, perhaps many more, hundreds or thousands, given how rapidly chatbots are being deployed, and the near total lack of regulation on how they can be used. And, second, because I found the reaction of some on the Twitterverse has to be callous, in part because people were clearly unfamiliar with the facts of the case, and I am hoping that people\u2019s sensitivity to the case might increase if they understand what happened.Do you see this particular case as an instance of something larger? As chatbots and chat-based search grow in popularity, I expect that large language models will serve up a lot of incompetent advice; there will be real harm to mental and physical health. (Of course they will also serve up some good advice, too. The fundamental issue is that chatbots are neither reliable nor truthful, and at the same time don\u2019t really grasp things like human psychology.)Why does it matter? People have committed suicide in other circumstances, including based on things they have read in books, internet chatroom, etc? First, every life matters; second, scale matters; third the intimacy that people develop with chatbots matters. It took only a couple months for the first incident to pop up; we may see a lot more. We don\u2019t ban seatbelts because some people in motor vehicles die anyway. We should address this situation, even if there are others.Does this mean that large language models have no place in mental health care? No; it just means we probably shouldn\u2019t use them to deliver therapy unless and until we become more confident in them. As Tom Insel, the psychiatrist/neuroscientist who ran the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) from 2002 until 2015, put it to me in an email, \u201cI do think AI can transform mental health care, but not via a chatbot. In fact, that may be the last thing I would want GPT4 to do (in mental health).\u00a0Documentation, reports, decision support -- all seem more useful in the near term.\u201d Let\u2019s use LLM\u2019s where there can be help, and be cautious where they might cause harm.Do you think that the chatbot induced harm is the greatest risk from chatbots? No. I think there is a wide array of potential near-term harms. I am particularly concerned that wholesale, plausible misinformation may create an atmosphere of mistrust, potentially undermining democracy; I also worry that large language models might also be weaponized to trick users as parts of large-scale (perhaps unprecedentedly large scale) cybercrime operations. Medium-term we will likely see significant disruptions of employment. Ultimately I see the societal impact of those three as likely larger than the chatbot-administered medical and psychiatric advice, but I do remain quite concerned about the implications of not always competent medical and psychiatric advice.  Should these bots be available to unaccompanied minors? Children can be quite vulnerable. There is certainly an argument that we should wait until these reliability issues have been addressed. If you share my concerns, please consider signing this thoughtful letter:Nathalie Smuha @NathalieSmuhaThis week, we wrote another #OpenLetter on #AI, urging for action against the risk of manipulation.\n\nIt was signed by 100 experts & can be read here: law.kuleuven.be/ai-summer-scho\u2026\n\nWe hope this leads to broader public debate.

This will be Eliza's final word to Pierre.\"Further context (again in translation) \"When one rereads their conversations, one can see that at a certain point, the relationship shifts into a mystical register. He evokes the idea of sacrificing himself if Eliza agrees to take care of the planet and save humanity through artificial intelligence.\" The experience was tragic, and underscores the fact that vulnerable people may over attribute wisdom and intelligence to machines that don\u2019t really understand humanity. My hope is that we can learn something from this going forward."}

Most people I\u2019ve spoken to in the AI community in the last few weeks are. I\u2019m more concerned about bad outcomes for AI now than at any other point in my life. Many of us who have worked on AI are either feeling remorse or concerned that we might soon come to feel remorse; Ezra Klein wrote about a delegation of people from big AI companies speaking to him about their off-record-fears. I am putting my fear here, on the record.Probably each of us is different. Some are frightened about some eventual superintelligence that might take over the world; my current fears have less to do with recent advances in technology per se, and more to do with recent observations about people.I wasn\u2019t feeling this a way year ago. Sure, I was skeptical that large language models would lead to general intelligence, I was worried about the coming thread of misinformation, and I was worried that we were wasting time on what LeCun later described as an off-ramp, but I was still seeing the AI community writ large as growing up, increasingly recognizing the value of responsible AI. Forward-thinking conferences like The ACM\u2019s FAccT (Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency) were growing in size and influence. Corporations like Microsoft were putting out statements on responsible AI; I thought they had learned their lesson from the Tay debacle. Google was holding off on releasing LaMDA, knowing it wasn\u2019t fully ready for prime time. On a 1-10 scale of least worried to most worried, I was at a 6. Now I am at an I- don\u2019t-think-about-much-else 9.\u00a7Greed seemed to increase in late November, when ChatGPT started to take off. $ signs flashed. Microsoft started losing cloud market, and saw OpenAI\u2019s work as a way to take back search. Nadella started to seem like a villain out of a Marvel movie, declaring in February he wants to make Google \u201ccome out and show that they can dance\u201d, and \u201cI want people to know that we made them dance.\u201d1OpenAI, meanwhile, more or less finalized its transformation from its original missionto a company that at present for all practical purposes is a for-profit, heavily constrained by the need to generate a financial return, working around Microsoft\u2019s goals, with far less emphasis on the admirable humanitarian goals in their initial charter. Their 10 billion dollar deal earlier this year accelerated that transition.Then along came Kevin Roose\u2019s infamous batshit crazy mid-February conversation with Sydney; I thought for sure Microsoft would take Sydney down after that. But they didn\u2019t. Instead they put up some risible band-aids (like limiting the lengths of conversations) and declared on 60 Minutes (same early March episode in which I had appeared) that they had solved the problems in 24 hours. The reality is far more complex. (E.g. one can still easily jailbreak Bing and get it to produce egregious misinformation.)The real reason I signed The Letter was not because I thought the moratorium had any realistic chance of being implemented but because I thought it was time for people to speak up in a coordinated way.At some level the petition worked; Capitol Hill, for example, pretty clearly got the message that we can\u2019t sit around forever on these issues. But in other ways, I have even more concerns than before.\u00a7The main thing that worries me is that I see self-interest on all sides, and not just the corporate players, when what we really need is coordinated action. What we need coordinated action on is actually pretty obvious, and it was spelled out perfectly clearly in the letter. Contrary to rumor, the letter didn\u2019t call for a ban on research; it called for a shift in research.AI research and development should be refocused on making today's powerful, state-of-the-art systems more accurate, safe, interpretable, transparent, robust, aligned, trustworthy, and loyal./Who on earth could actually object to that? Whether or not you want a pause, the reality is that large language models remain exactly what I have always described them to be: bulls in a china shop, powerful, reckless, and difficult to control. Making new systems that are \u201cmore accurate, safe, interpretable, transparent, robust, aligned, trustworthy, and loyal\u201d should literally be at the top of everyone\u2019s agenda.No sane person should have opposed that prescription.\u00a7Of course, the proposed moratorium as a whole could have reasonably been criticized at a lot of levels. It was definitely too hypey around the imminence of artificial general intelligence (I held my nose on that point); there is no obvious way to get ensure compliance; China might go ahead anyway; we don\u2019t even know how to evaluate the proposed ban\u2019s main criterion. (The ban called for halting systems more powerful than GPT-4, presumably as indexed by size and we don\u2019t even know how large GPT-4 is; again, I held my nose, having seen the letter only after a bunch of signatories had already signed on.)To be honest, I would have preferred my own proposed moratorium, co-written a month earlier, with Canadian Member of Parliament Michelle Rempel Garner, which called for a temporary ban on widescale deployment (not research), until we could put in a regulatory infrastructure modeled on establishing the safety of medicines, with phased roll out and safety cases. But by the time I saw the FLI letter, it had already been finalized and perhaps 30 significant people had signed on. Instead of publicly criticizing the proposal, or pushing my own, I felt that building a coalition was important. I saw that folks like Yoshua Bengio, focused as much on current reality as I am, and Steve Wozniak (who doesn\u2019t seem to have any particularly vested interest) had signed on. There was a chance to build bridges\u2014not just with an echo chamber of my besties (like Grady Booch, with whom I am roughly 97% aligned), but with people I often disagree with, like Musk and Bengio. As I have said twice now in closing at the AGIdebates, it is going to take a village to raise an AI. If we want to get to AI we can trust, probably the first thing we are going to need is a coalition.\u00a7But nooooooo, as John Belushi used to say on Saturday Night Live. A coalition was not in the cards. Instead we got a shitstorm, like the shitstorm of the 1968 Chicago Democratic Convention, which did nothing for the Democrats, and everything for their opponent, Richard Nixon, who soon became President.Instead of signing on, a lot of self proclaimed AI ethicists decided to dump on the letter. A prominent and pretty typical example was the letter from Timnit Gebru\u2019s DAIR, which went for blood rather than seeking common ground:@timnitGebru@dair-community.social on Mastodon @timnitGebruSince we've been looking for more things to do, @emilymbender @mmitchell_ai @mcmillan_majora and I wrote a statement about the horrible \"letter\" on the AI apocalypse, the very first citation of which, was our #StochasticParrots paper. \ndair-institute.org/blog/letter-st\u2026 7:59 PM \u2219 Mar 31, 20231,578Likes808RetweetsTo be sure, the DAIR letter ultimately lands on a reasonable conclusion:@timnitGebru@dair-community.social on Mastodon @timnitGebruInstead, we should focus on the very real and very present exploitative practices of the companies claiming to build them, who are rapidly centralizing power and increasing social inequities.8:03 PM \u2219 Mar 31, 2023114Likes24RetweetsBut there is still an unfortunate kind of imperialism, a view that their (very legitimate and important) cause\u2014exploitative practices\u2014outweighs all others; not \u201ca focus\u201d but \u201cthe focus.\u201d  Why focus only on that, and not also say the enormously dangerous potential of mass misinformation, which people like Renee DiResta and I have often emphasized, or the risks of cybercrime that Europol recently emphasized? Don\u2019t each of these risks in part lead to a common cause - reining in errant software\u2013  that we all should consider?  Surely, after all the criticism that Gebru and Bender have leveled against LLMs they can\u2019t think that building GPT-5 is all that great an idea. In their zeal to distance themselves from the Future of Life crowd, though, it seems to me that they missed an opportunity to decry even more powerful versions of systems that have already proven problematic. This opportunity has been lost; I hope there will be more of a spirit of collaboration as subsequent proposals emerge.For now, all the technolibertarians are probably cackling; if they had wanted to sabotage the \u201cdevelop AI with care\u201d  crowd, they couldn\u2019t have found a better way to divide and conquer.In truth, over 50,000 people signed the letter, including a lot of people who have nothing to do with the long term risk movement that the FLI itself is associated with. These include, for example, Yoshua Bengio (the most cited AI researcher in recent years), Stuart Russell (a well-known AI researcher at Berkeley), Pattie Maes (a prominent AI researcher at MIT), John Hopfield (a physicist whose original work on machine learning has been massively influential), Victoria Krakovna (a leading researcher at DeepMind working on how to get machines to do what we want them to do), and Grady Booch (a pioneering software architect who has been speaking out about the unreliability of current techniques as an approach to software engineering). But a few loud voices have overshadowed the 50,000 who have signed.I have rarely seen a cartoon that better captures how I am feeling than this one:Sophia Andren @razorbelle@GaryMarcus The response to the letter does not bode well for our species. 3:07 AM \u2219 Apr 1, 202320Likes3Retweets\u00a7And then there were the tech bros, spouting nonsense, like Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong:Back in the real world, of course there is disagreement and marketplaces of ideas and troubles with democracy,  but there are also  tons of examples of successful regulation, like seatbelt laws, which have saved something like 300,000 lives.

The idea (which I have actually heard expressed) that AI should be exempt from regulation is absurd.  \u00a7One criticism do I agree with is thisWalid Saba @sabawalid@GaryMarcus I personally did not like the letter and not because of the sponsor that I know nothing about, but because it gives too much credit to the misguided hype.

Some thought I had misinterpreted the Hinton tweet (given my independent sourcing, I am quite sure I didn\u2019t); others complained that I was focusing on the wrong set of risks (either too much on the short-term, or too much on the long term). One distinguished colleague wrote to me asking \u201cwon\u2019t this [FLI] letter create unjustified fears of imminent AGI, superintelligence, etc?\u201d Some people were so surprised by my amplifying Hinton\u2019s concerns that a whole Twitter thread popped up speculating about my own beliefs:Alexander Berger @albrgrI\u2019m so confused by what Marcus thinks https://t.co/9ZSjNeB3JGGary Marcus @GaryMarcusTake this seriously:  \u2066@geoffreyhinton\u2069 on AI possibly wiping out humanity: \u2018It's not inconceivable\u2019 \n\nIs coding faster and having fun chatbots to play with worth a 1% risk of that coming true? https://t.co/qJ4S00ttKk5:51 PM \u2219 Mar 27, 2023My beliefs have not in fact changed. I still don\u2019t think large language models have much to do with superintelligence or artificial general intelligence [AGI]; I still think, with Yann LeCun, that LLMs are an \u201coff-ramp\u201d on the road to AGI. And my scenarios for doom are perhaps not the same as Hinton\u2019s or Musk\u2019s; theirs (from what I can tell) seem to center mainly around what happens if computers rapidly and radically self-improve themselves, which I don\u2019t see as an immediate possibility.But here\u2019s the thing: although a lot of the literature equates artificial intelligence risk with the risk of superintelligence or artificial general intelligence, you don\u2019t have to be superintelligent to create serious problems. I am not worried, immediately, about \u201cAGI risk\u201d (the risk of superintelligent machines beyond our control), in the near term I am worried about what I will call \u201cMAI risk\u201d\u2014Mediocre AI that is unreliable (a la Bing and GPT-4) but widely deployed\u2014both in terms of the sheer number of people using it, and in terms of the access that the software has to the world. A company called Adept.AI just raised $350 million dollars to do just that, to allow large language models to access, well, pretty much everything (aiming to \u201csupercharge your capabilities on any software tool or API in the world\u201d with LLMs, despite their clear tendencies towards hallucination and unreliability).Lots of ordinary humans, perhaps of above average intelligence but not necessarily genius-level, have created all kinds of problems throughout history; in many ways, the critical variable is not intelligence but power, which often caches out as access. In principle, a single idiot with the nuclear codes could destroy the world, with only a modest amount of intelligence and a surplus of ill-deserved access. If an LLM can trick a single human into doing a Captcha, as OpenAI recently observed, it can, in the hands of a bad actor, create all kinds of mayhem. When LLMs were a lab curiosity, known only within the field, they didn\u2019t pose much problem. But now that (a) they are widely known, and of interest to criminals, and (b) increasingly being given access to the external world (including humans), they can do more damage.Although the AI community often focuses on long-term risk, I am not alone in worrying about serious, immediate implications. Europol came out yesterday with a report considering some of the criminal possibilities, and it\u2019s sobering. They emphasize misinformation, as I often have, and a whole lot more:Gary Marcus @GaryMarcusmust-read:\n\ud83d\udc49\u201cphishing & online fraud can be created faster, much more authentically, & at significantly increased scale.\u201d\n\ud83d\udc49 LLMs can \u201cbe abused ..to mislead potential victims into placing their trust in the hands of criminal actors.\u201d\n\ud83d\udc49LLMs \u201cmay facilitate terrorist activities\u201d https://t.co/MmsQ5dd0BQEuropol @Europol\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udcc4 New #TechWatch flash report: \u201cChatGPT - the impact of Large Language Models on Law Enforcement.\u201d\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f The report provides an overview on the potential criminal misuse of LLMs and discusses the impact they might have on law enforcement.\n\nRead it here \u2935\ufe0f\nhttps://t.co/M8X8EQis26 https://t.co/8ZZoiLsdzX12:10 AM \u2219 Mar 28, 2023Here\u2019s an excerpt of what they said about fraud and terrorism:With the help of LLMs, these types of phishing and online fraud can be created faster, much more authentically, and at significantly increased scale.The ability of LLMs to detect and re-produce language patterns does not only facilitate phishing and online fraud, but can also generally be used to impersonate the style of speech of specific individuals or groups. This capability can be abused at scale to mislead potential victims into placing their trust in the hands of criminal actors.In addition to the criminal activities outlined above, the capabilities of ChatGPT lend themselves to a number of potential abuse cases in the area of terrorism, propaganda, and disinformation. As such, the model can be used to generally gather more information that may facilitate terrorist activities, such as for instance, terrorism financing or anonymous file sharing.Perhaps coupled with mass AI-generated propaganda, LLM-enhanced terrorism could in turn lead to nuclear war, or to the deliberate spread of pathogens worse than covid-19, etc. Many, many people could die; civilization could be utterly disrupted. Maybe humans would not literally be \u201cwiped from the earth,\u201d but things could get very bad indeed.How likely is any of this? We have no earthly idea. My 1% number in the tweet was just a thought experiment. But it\u2019s not 0%. Hinton\u2019s phrase \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s not inconceivable\u201d \u2014 was exactly right, and I think it applies both to some of the long-term scenarios that people like Eliezer Yudkowsky have worried about, and some of the short-term scenarios that Europol and I have worried about.\u00a7 The real issue is control. Hinton\u2019s worry, as articulated in the article I linked in my tweet above (itself a summary of a CBS interview) was about what happens if we lose control of self-improving machines. I don\u2019t know when we will get to such machines, but I do know that we don\u2019t have tons of controls over current AI, especially now that people can hook them up to TaskRabbit and real-world software APIs. We need to stop worrying (just) about Skynet and robots taking over the world, and think a lot more about what criminals, including terrorists, might do with LLMs, and what, if anything, we might do to stop them.  But we also need to treat LLMs as a dress rehearsal future synthetic intelligence, and ask ourselves hard questions about what on earth we are going to do with future technology, which might well be even more difficult to control. Hinton told CBS, \u201cI think it's very reasonable for people to be worrying about these issues now, even though it's not going to happen in the next year or two\u201d, and I agree.It\u2019s not an either/or situation; current technology already poses enormous risks that we are ill-prepared for. With future technology, things could well get worse. Criticizing people for focusing on the \u201cwrong risks\u201d (an ever popular sport on Twitter) isn\u2019t helping anybody; there\u2019s enough risk to go around.

Should I stop caring about lead paint because there are guns, or vice versa?Importantly, AI may well directly or indirectly accelerate many of these risks (e.g., misinformation, future pandemics, rogue nuclear weapon launches, misuse of CRISPR, etc).

That claim would never survive serious scientific peer review.

As I have said before, I don\u2019t really think GPT-4 has much to do with AGI. The strengths and weaknesses of GPT-4 are qualitatively the same as before. The problem of hallucinations is not solved; reliability is not solved; planning on complex tasks is (as the authors themselves acknowledge) not solved. But there is a more serious concern that has been coalescing in my mind in recent days, and it comes in two parts.The first is that the two giant OpenAI and Microsoft papers have been about a model about which absolutely nothing has been revealed, not the architecture, nor the training set. Nothing. They reify the practice of substituting press releases for science and the practice of discussing models with entirely undisclosed mechanisms and data.Imagine if some random crank said, I have a really great idea, and you should give me a lot of scientific credibility for it, but I am not going to tell you a thing about how it works, just going to show you the output of my model. You would archive the message without reading further. The paper\u2019s core claim\u2014 \u201cGPT-4 attains a form of general intelligence [as] demonstrated by its core mental capabilities (such as reasoning, creativity, and deduction)\u201d\u2014literally cannot be tested with serious scrutiny, because the scientific community has no access to the training data. Everything must be taken on faith (and yet there already have been reports of contamination in the training data).Kate Crawford @katecrawfordThere is a real problem here. Scientists and researchers like me have no way to know what Bard, GPT4, or Sydney are trained on. Companies refuse to say. This matters, because training data is part of the core foundation on which models are built. Science relies on transparency.12:52 PM \u2219 Mar 22, 2023466Likes120RetweetsWorse, as Ernie Davis told me yesterday, OpenAI has begun to incorporate user experiments into the training corpus, killing the scientific community\u2019s ability to test the single most critical question: the ability of these models to generalize to new test cases. Perhaps all this would all be fine if the companies weren\u2019t pretending to be contributors to science, formatting their work as science with graphs and tables and abstracts as if they were reporting ideas that had been properly vetted. I don\u2019t expect Coca Cola to present its secret formula. But nor do I plan to give them scientific credibility for alleged advances that we know nothing about.Now here\u2019s the thing, if Coca Cola  wants to keep secrets, that\u2019s fine; it\u2019s not particularly in the public interest to know the exact formula. But what if they suddenly introducing a new self-improving formula with in principle potential to end democracy or give people potentially fatal medical advice or to seduce people into committing criminal acts? At some point, we would want public hearings. Microsoft and OpenAI are rolling out extraordinarily powerful yet unreliable systems with multiple disclosed risks and no clear measure either of their safety or how to constrain them. By excluding the scientific community from any serious insight into the design and function of these models, Microsoft and OpenAI are placing the public in a position in which those two companies alone are in a position do anything about the risks to which they are exposing us all.This cannot and should not stand. Even OpenAI\u2019s CEO Sam Altman has recently publicly expressed  fears about where this is all going. Microsoft and OpenAI are producing and deploying products with potentially enormous risks at mass scale, and making extravagant, unreviewed and unreviewable claims about them, without  sketching serious solutions to any of the potential problems they themselves have identified.We must demand transparency, and if we don\u2019t get it, we must contemplate shutting these projects down.

It can see (though we don\u2019t have a lot of details on that yet); it does astonishingly well on a whole bunch of standardized tests, like LSATs, GREs, and SATs. It has also already been adopted in a bunch of commercial systems (e.g., Khan Academy). But it is a failure, too, becauseIt doesn\u2019t actually solve any of the core problems of truthfulness and reliability that I laid out in my infamous March 2022 essay Deep Learning is Hitting a Wall. Alignment is still shaky; you still wouldn\u2019t be able to use it reliably to guide robots or scientific discovery, the kinds of things that made me excited about A(G)I in the first place. Outliers remain a problem, too.  The limit section in some ways reads like a reprise of that March 2022 paper. And the article doesn\u2019t offer authoritative solutions to any of those earlier problems. In their own words: Massive scaling has not thus far lead to revolution. Although GPT-4 is clearly better than GPT-3 and 3.5, it is not so far as I can tell, qualitatively better, only quantitatively better; as noted above, the limits remain more or less the same. The quantitative improvements may (or may not) have considerable commercial implications in particular domains, but it\u2019s not the massive win for the scaling hypotheses that memes like this had forecast.GPT-4 is not thus far a solution to making Chat-style search work. On its own, it still requires frequent, massive retraining to be current with the news; GPT 3.5 knew nothing of 2022; GPT-4 seems to know little of 2023. And when GPT-4 is integrated in Bing (which incorporates current search results), hallucination remains rampant, e.g., in this example from last week when Bing apparently was already quietly using GPT-4 in the background.It is a step backwards for science, because it sets a new precedent for pretending to be scientific while revealing absolutely nothing.

The 2024 elections could be unlike anything we have seen before.\u201d  On Sam Harris\u2019 podcast Making Sense last week  I had an intense and fascinating discussion with Berkeley Professsor Stuart Russell, on both short term and long term risks in AI that left me a little shaken. In some way I play the moderate to Stuart Russell\u2019s alarmism. But I\u2019m not that moderate. The disorganized release of Sydney has left me significantly less confident in the AI industry\u2019s competence and eagerness to police itself. Of course I view ChatGPT as only dimly related to artificial general intelligence, but I do see it as dress rehearsal. And, by any reasonable measure, that dress rehearsal went badly. Russell and I discuss. To me the only solution to the long-term risk issue is to build machines with consensus human values, but we are a long way from knowing how to do that, and Russell (who shares my minority view that machines ought to have values they can reason over)) wants machines to learn those values from data, without innate constraint, and I am worried about where insufficiently constrained learning might read. Some said it was the AI podcast of the year; I do think it is worth your time. Katja Grace, lead researcher at AI Impacts recently surveyed 559 machine learning researchers on how we worried they are about really serious, truly bad outcomes for humanity stemming from AI.

He gave a series of lectures every year on linguistics and the mind. I went, and so did hundreds of other people. And every week, a bunch of folks would stand up and take cracks at Chomsky, convinced that if they could stump one of the smartest people in the world, as if it would prove that they, instead, were the smartest person in the world. None of them ever get very far, but Chomsky was implacable, patiently responding and dismantling all comers. The sport never ceased to entertain. 40 years on, and not much has changed.  Chomsky co-wrote a New York Times op-ed the other day, and everyone is out there once again to prove they are smarter than he is, in the smuggest possible language they can muster.UW linguist Emily Bender lead the brigade, with a kind of sneering condescension she often uses:@emilymbender@dair-community.social on Mastodon @emilymbenderSo it's real bummer when the world's most famous linguist writes an op-ed in the NYT* and gets it largely wrong.\n\nnytimes.com/2023/03/08/opi\u2026\n\n(*NYT famous for publishing transphobia & bad AI coverage, but widely read)\n\n>>nytimes.comOpinion | Noam Chomsky: The False Promise of ChatGPTThe most prominent strain of A.I. encodes a flawed conception of language and knowledge.2:26 PM \u2219 Mar 10, 2023137Likes24RetweetsBut when one reads on, to the rest of her thread, there just isn\u2019t that much there. She complains that Chomsky dwells too much on grammaticality (true, but kind of besides the point) and says he is too focused on innateness, writing that \u201cthe whole debate about whether or not humans have an innate universal grammar is just completely beside the point here\u201d but gives no argument whatsoever, of any form, to make her point. (Just in case you didn\u2019t get that point that Bender is positive that she\u2019s smarter than Chomsky, she ends her thread by encouraging readers to read a recent profile of her in New York magazine, \u201cSo, read this, not that\u201d.) And of course Bender doesn\u2019t bother to acknowledge that she actually agrees that LLMs (in her terms \u201cstochastic parrots\u201d are a lousy model of language, because the statistically parrot their inputs. Nor is she gracious enough to acknowledge that Chomsky first made that point in the early 1960s, before the author of stochastic parrots was born.Then there\u2019s Scott Aaronson, computer scientist best known for his work on quantum computation. He\u2019s too joined the jump on Chomsky sweepstakes, accusing Chomsky (and others who have criticized large language models) of being \u201cself-certain, hostile, and smug\u201d in an essay that is, well, self-certain, hostile and smug\u2014 filled with passages like \u201cTo my astonishment and delight, even many of the anti-LLM AI experts are refusing to defend Chomsky\u2019s attack-piece\u201dAlas there is again very little substantial content, beyond the sneering. Aaronson\u2019s biggest error, now corrected, sort of, in bold, is in assuming that Chomsky has spent his life in some sort of failed effort to build AI, which kind of entirely misses the point of Chomsky\u2019s piece (which says in so many words that we need to study the mind first before we try to make AI) and also utterly misrepresents Chomsky\u2019s career.  Frankly, I would be embarrassed to have to publish a correction (the part in bold) like this:It\u2019s a wild swing and a miss. Chomsky has spent his career trying to understand how humans acquire language, not \u201cbuilding machines\u201d to try to do the same.If Aaronson had bothered to ask, I am pretty sure Chomsky would have said, roughly, \u201csince the ways in which humans acquire language remain a mystery, all this AI engineering is missing a source of insight that is likely to be essential, so it\u2019s premature. (Or at least that\u2019s pretty much what he said at the recent AGIdebate I hosted.) Aaronson\u2019s condescension and erroneous characterization doesn\u2019t change any of that. Another  swing and a miss, slightly better but still unconvincing, comes from the noted neuroscientist/machine learning expert (and leaders of the famous NeurIPS conference) Terry Sejnowski, in an email to a leading machine learning email list. Sejnowski affecting a different but still unmistakeable flavor of condescension, \u201cI have always been impressed with Chomsky's ability to use plausible arguments to make his case even when they were fallacious\u201d. To his credit Sejnowski correctly  picked on a weak point in the oped: Chomsky\u2019s ChatGPT examples falling apples and gravity were anecdotal and insufficiently nuanced. But the email group quickly tore Sejnowski apart; his own examples were equally anecdotal.  (As discussed below, Sejnowski\u2019s retort \u2014 \u201cIf you ask a nonsense question, you get a nonsense answer... LLMs mirror the intelligence of the prompt\u201d \u2014 doesn\u2019t actually hold water.)Neither Chomsky nor Sejnowski grappled enough with a critical reality: ChatGPT is wildly stochastic and unreliable; so single examples prove little. Still, even though Chomsky\u2019s argument surely could have used considerably more nuance (see my article with Ernest Davis on how not to evaluate GPT), his overall point is correct: LLMs don\u2019t reliably understand the world. And they certainly haven\u2019t taught as anything whatsoever about why the world is at it is, rather than some other way. Ditto for the human mind.But wait, there\u2019s more.  Machine learning prof Tom Dietterich joined in, trying to persuade the crowd that  ChatGPT has some form of comprehension in some deep sense (which both Chomsky and I seriously doubt).ChatGPT\u2019s errors reveal that its \u201cunderstanding\u201d of the world is not systematic but rather consists of patches of competence separated by regions of incompetence and incoherence. ChatCPT would be much stronger if it could fill in the gaps between those patches by appealing to general causal models. This raises two questions: (a) how could a system learn such causal models and (b) how could we test a system to determine whether it had succeeded.I chimed in, doubting the \u201cregions of competence notion\u201d, in a stochastic and unreliable system that sometimes has closely related text to draw on and sometimes doesn\u2019t:If a broken clock were correct twice a day, would we give it credit for patches of understanding of time? If n-gram model [a simple statistical tool to which nobody in their right mind would attribute comprehension] produced a sequence that was 80% grammatical, would we attribute to an underlying understanding of grammar?At this point, Machine learning superstar Geoff Hinton joined in the fray, too, in the very same machine learning email list:A former student of mine, James Martens,\u00a0 came up with the following way of demonstrating chatGPT's lack of understanding. He asked it how many legs the rear left side of a cat has.\u00a0It said 4.\u00a0\u00a0I asked a learning disabled young adult the same question. He used the index finger and thumb of both hands pointing downwards to represent the legs on the two sides of the cat and said 4.He has problems understanding some sentences, but he gets by quite well in the world and people are often surprised to learn that he has a disability.\u00a0Do you really want to use the fact that he misunderstood this question to say that he has no understanding at all?Are you really happy with using the fact that chatGPT sometimes misunderstands to claim that it never understands?GeoffTo which I replied at much greater length, because the issues are both subtle and critical:Geoff, Terry (mentioned below) and others,You raise an important question.Of course learning disabled people can understand some things and not others. Just as some computer scientists understand computer science and not psychology, etc. (and vice versa; unfortunately a lot of psychologists have never written a line of code, and that often undermines their work).That said your remark was itself a deflection away from my own questions, which I will reprint here, since you omitted them.If a broken clock were correct twice a day, would we give it credit for patches of understanding of time? If n-gram model produced a sequence that was 80% grammatical, would we attribute to an underlying understanding of grammar?The point there (salient to every good cognitive psychologist) is that you can\u2019t infer underlying psychology and internal representations directly from behavior.A broken clock is behaviorally correct (occasionally) but it doesn\u2019t have a functioning internal representation of time. An n-gram model, for high-n, can produce fluent prose, but not have any underlying understanding or representations of what it is saying, succeding to the extent that it does by piggybacking onto a corpus of speech produced by humans that talk about a world that is largely regular.\u00a0Psychology is hard. Almost any \u201ccorrect\u201d behavior can be created in a multiplicity of ways; that\u2019s why (cognitive) psychologists who are interested in underlying representations so often look to errors, and tests of generalization.\u00a0In the case of LLMs, it\u2019s clear that even when they produce a correct output, they rarely if ever deribe the same abstractions that a human would, or that a symbolic machine might use (perhaps preprogrammed) in a similar circumstance.\u00a0Minerva, for example, is trained on an immense amount of data, and ostensibly captures two-digit arithmetic, but it fails altogether on 4-digit multiplication, The parsimonious explanation is that it is doing a kind of pattern recognition over stored examples (with 2-digit cases more densely sampled than 4-digit cases)\u2014rather than genuinely understanding what multiplication is about.\u00a0The same goes for essentially everything an LLMs talks about; there is a degree of generalization to similar examples, but distribution shift is hard (the crux of my own work going back to 1998), and nearly any generalization can be easily broken.\u00a0As a last example, consider the following, where it initially sort of seems like ChatGPT has understood both counting and sorting in the context of complex query\u2014which would be truly impressive\u2014but on inspection it gets the details wrong, because it is relying on similarity, and not actually inducing the abstractions that define counting or sorting.This example by the way also speaks against what Terry erroneously alleged yesterday (\u201cIf you ask a nonsense question, you get a nonsense answer... LLMs mirror the intelligence of the prompt\u201d).\u00a0The request is perfectly clear, not a nonsensical question in any way. The prompt is perfectly sensible; the system just isn\u2019t up to the job.\u00a7Hinton hasn\u2019t replied yet, and I sort of doubt he will. The reality is that what I said, and what Chomsky said, is correct: the system really isn\u2019t up to the job.The oped wasn\u2019t perfect. It was overwritten, with needlessly inflammatory language (eg needlessly editorializing adjectives like lumbering to describe large language models). And it could have been more careful about the use of anecdotal data in evaluating AI systems; the arguments around common sense could have been more sharply drawn. There wasn\u2019t much contact with relevant empirical literature.. It could have been a little more effusive about the positive applications of LLMs (probably warned more about the negative applications). And there wasn\u2019t an enormous amount there that was genuinely new.But there is no real argument against Chomsky\u2019s overall take: these systems are useful technology but remain a long way from true artificial intelligence, and they are even further from telling us anything useful about the function of the human mind.By my scorecard, (counting the trilateral attack by three machine learning experts as a single joint tag team round) the score overall is Chomsky 4, Challengers 0.Just like old times.SubscribeGary Marcus (@garymarcus), scientist, bestselling author, and entrepreneur, is a skeptic about current AI but genuinely wants to see the best AI possible for the world\u2014and still holds a tiny bit of optimism.

{"title": "Is it time to hit the pause button on AI?", "link": "https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/is-it-time-to-hit-the-pause-button", "date": "2023-02-26T18:17:24.028Z", "content": "Earlier this month, Microsoft released their revamped Bing search engine\u2014complete with a powerful AI-driven chatbot\u2014to an initially enthusiastic reception. Kevin Roose in The New York Times was so impressed that he reported being in \"awe.\"But Microsoft's new product also turns out to have a dark side. A week after release, the chatbot - known internally within Microsoft as \"Sydney\" - was making entirely different headlines, this time for suggesting it would harm and blackmail users and wanted to escape its confines. Later, it was revealed that disturbing incidents like this had occurred months before the formal public launch. Roose's initial enthusiasm quickly turned into concern after a two-hour-long conversation with Bing in which the chatbot declared its love for him and tried to push him toward a divorce from his wife.\u00a0Some will be tempted to chuckle at these stories and view them as they did a previously ill-fated Microsoft chatbot named Tay, released in 2016; as a minor embarrassment for Microsoft. But things have dramatically changed since then.\u00a0The AI technology that powers today\u2019s \"chatbots\" like Sydney (Bing) and OpenAI's ChatGPT is vastly more powerful, and far more capable of fooling people. Moreover, the new breed of systems are wildly popular and have enjoyed rapid, mass adoption by the general public, and with greater adoption comes greater risk. And whereas in 2016, when Microsoft voluntarily pulled Tay after it began spouting racist invective, today, the company is locked in a high-stakes battle with Google that seems to be leading both companies towards aggressively releasing technologies that have not been well vetted.Already we have seen people try to retrain these chatbots for political purposes. There's also a high risk that they will be used to create misinformation at an unprecedented scale. In the last few days, the new AI systems have led to the suspension of submissions at a science fiction publisher because it couldn't cope with a deluge of machine-generated stories. Another chatbot company, Replika, changed policies in light of the Sydney fiasco in ways that led to acute emotional distress for some of its users. Chatbots are also causing colleges to scramble due to newfound ease of plagiarism; and the frequent plausible, authoritative, but wrong answers they give that could be mistaken as fact are also troubling. Concerns are being raised about the impact of this on everything from political campaigns to stock markets. Several major Wall Street banks have banned the internal use of ChatGPT, with an internal source at JPMorgan citing compliance concerns. All of this has happened in just a few weeks, and no one knows what exactly will happen next.Meanwhile, it's become clear that tech companies have not fully prepared for the consequences of this dizzying pace of deployment of next-generation AI technology. Microsoft's decision to release its chatbot likely with prior knowledge of disturbing incidents is one example of ignoring the ethical principles they laid out in recent years. So it's hard to shake the feeling that big tech has gotten ahead of their skis.\u00a0With the use of this new technology exploding into the masses, previously unknown risks being revealed each day, and big tech companies pretending everything is fine, there is an expectation that the government might step in. But so far, legislators have taken little concrete action. And the reality is that even if lawmakers were suddenly gripped with an urgent desire to address this issue, most governments don't have the institutional nimbleness, or frankly knowledge, needed to match the current speed of AI development.\u00a0The global absence of a comprehensive policy framework to ensure AI alignment - that is, safeguards to ensure an AI's function doesn't harm humans - begs for a new approach.\u00a0Logically speaking, in this context, there are three options for proceeding.Option one would be for the government to continue with the status quo. Leave technology companies to their own devices, trust them to sort themselves out without any more regulations, and hope they will learn to corral their AI and find better, less chaotic ways of rolling them out.Option two is to take the opposite approach, as prominent psychologist Geoffrey Miller recently proposed, and enact an outright ban on these new forms of AI In a recent brief essay Miller argued, \"If we're serious that Al imposes existential risks on humanity, then the best thing that Al companies can do to help us survive this pivotal century is simple: Shut down their Al research.\"But there is a third option, somewhere between these two poles, where government might allow for controlled AI research with a pause on large-scale AI deployment (e.g., open-ended chatbots rapidly rolled out to hundreds of millions of customers) until an effective framework that ensures AI safety is developed.\u00a0There is plenty of precedent for this type of approach. New pharmaceuticals, for example, begin with small clinical trials and move to larger trials with greater numbers of people, but only once sufficient evidence has been produced for government regulators to believe they are safe. Publicly funded research that impacts humans is already required to be vetted through some type of research ethics board.Given that the new breed of AI systems have demonstrated the ability to manipulate humans, tech companies could be subjected to similar oversight.Recent events suggest new applications of AI could be governed similarly to these two examples, with authorities set up to evaluate and regulate the release of new major applications based on carefully-delineated evidence of safety. More transparency about how decisions about widespread AI product releases are made is probably also needed.The status quo offers none of this type of governance. At present, anybody can release AI at whatever scale they like, with virtually no oversight, literally overnight. As was the case in the release of thalidomide, a porous and loose oversight system can allow products with no business being released to the public for use that causes harm. Events of recent weeks certainly suggest that the big titans of tech have shown they do not yet have the AI situation under control.\u00a0Under normal circumstances, a more laissez-faire approach might be preferable for developing emerging technology; the lesson of the social media era, though, is that big technology companies often disregard consequences. For the government to play catchup yet again seems foolhardy as we move towards technologies that may exceed human cognitive capabilities. Never before has humanity had to address the integration of a transformative technology that has the potential to behave in this way.At the same time, an outright ban on even studying AI risks throwing the baby out with the bathwater and could keep humanity from developing transformative technology that could revolutionize science, medicine, and technology.The Goldilocks choice here is obvious. It\u2019s time for government to consider frameworks that allow for AI research under a set of rules that provide ethical standards and safety, while pausing the widespread public dissemination of potentially risky new AI technologies\u2014with severe penalties for misuse - until we can be assured of the safety of new technologies that the world frankly doesn't yet fully understand.Gary Marcus is a professor emeritus at NYU, Founder and CEO of Geometric Intelligence (acquired by Uber), and author of five books including Guitar Zero and Rebooting AI.\u00a0Michelle Rempel Garner is a Canadian Member of Parliament, a former economic cabinet Minister and former Vice-Chair of the Canadian House of Commons Standing Committees on Industry, Natural Resources, and Health.SubscribeShare"}

The first paragraph read as follows:That was then.Perhaps as side effect of the Bing/Sydney fiasco, one of the leading chatbots just changed course radically midstream, not for a single user, but for all users. (In particular, this instance a popular feature for erotic role play  was removed). To someone who doesn\u2019t use the system, that may not seem like a big deal, but some users get quite attached. Sex and love, even simulated, are powerful urges; some people are apparently in genuine emotional pain, as result of the change.Vice reports:Replika is a tool for many people who use it to support their mental health, and many people value it as an outlet for romantic intimacy. The private, judgment-free conversations are a way for many users to experiment with connection, and overcome depression, anxiety, and PTSD that affect them outside of the app.\u00a0For some people, maybe the only thing worse than a deranged, gaslighting chatbot is a fickle chatbot that abandons them.  \u00a7As a the child of a psychotherapist who has followed clinical psychology for three decades, I know how vulnerable some people can be. I am genuinely concerned. This is a moment we should learn from. Hopefully nothing bad happens this time; but we need to reflect about what kind of society we are building.What we are seeing is a disconcerting combination of factsMore and more people are using chatbotsFew people understand how they work; many people anthropomorphizing those chatbots, attributing to them real intelligence and emotion. Kevin Roose writes about AI for a living and was genuinely concerned about what Sydney was saying. Naive users may take these bots even more seriously.Larger language models seems more and more human-like (but the emotions that they present are no more real). Whatever we see now is likely to escalate.Some people are building real attachments to those botsIn some cases, those who are building bots that actively cultivate those attachments, e.g., by feigning romantic and/or sexual interest or by dotting their messages with \u201cfriendly\u201d emoticons. Changes in those bots could leave many people in a vulnerable place.There is essentially zero regulation on what these chatbots can say or do or how they can change over time, or on how they might treat their users.Taking on a user in a chatbot like Replika is a long term commitment. But no known technology can reliably align a chatbot in a persistent way to a human\u2019s emotional needs. To my knowledge, tech companies are free to leverage a human gullibility around chatbot technologies however they like, without consequence, just as big teach companies previously leveraged to a human need for attention to the point of creating addictions to social media, even to the point of sometimes causing \u201cTwitter poisoning\u201d; with the new generation of chatbots, we will see addictions no less potent.

ChatGPT tended not to do this kind of stuff (unless you used \u201cjailbreaking\u201d techniques to try to trick it), whereas from what I can tell, Bing went off the rails really fast. And the thing is, the two systems are basically close siblings; OpenAI built ChatGPT, and is now presumed to be working very closely with Microsoft, using the same technology. ChatGPT was, I believe, mainly powered by GPT 3.5 plus a module known as RLHF (which combines Reinforcement learning with human feedback, to put some guardrails in place). We all assumed that Bing\u2019s Chatbot was more or less the same thing, but powered instead by a bigger, newer version of 3.5, which I\u2019ll call GPT 3.6. (Or maybe it\u2019s GPT-4; Microsoft has been very coy about this.)Princeton professor Arvind Narayanan has the best thread I have seen on what\u2019s gone wrong. Let\u2019s start there;  I mostly agree with he said. His take, with a few annotations, and then three important follow-ups:Arvind Narayanan @random_walkerConsidering that OpenAI did a decent job of filtering ChatGPT\u2019s toxic outputs, it\u2019s mystifying that Bing seemingly decided to remove those guardrails. I don't think they did it just for s***s and giggles. Here are four reasons why Microsoft may have rushed to release the chatbot.1:11 PM \u2219 Feb 19, 2023484Likes90RetweetsGreat question; but maybe they didn\u2019t remove the guardrails; maybe the guardrails just didn\u2019t work? I will return to that possibility\u2014call it Possibility #5\u2013 below.Arvind Narayanan @random_walkerThe bot's behavior has enough differences from ChatGPT that it can't be the same underlying model. Maybe the LLM only recently completed training (GPT-4?) If so, Microsoft may have (unwisely) decided to roll it out promptly rather than delay it for RLHF training with humans.1:11 PM \u2219 Feb 19, 202371Likes5RetweetsNarayanan\u2019s Possibility 1 is that what we are seeing is a new model, possibly GPT-4, naked, unadorned by guardrails. As I wrote in Inside the Heart of ChatGPT\u2019s Darkness, there\u2019s a lot of nastiness lurking inside large language models; maybe MSFT did nothing to protect us from that.Arvind Narayanan @random_walkerPossibility #2: they built a filter for Bing chat, but it had too many false positives, just like ChatGPT's. With ChatGPT it was only a minor annoyance, but maybe in the context of search it leads to a more frustrating user experience.1:13 PM \u2219 Feb 19, 202349Likes4RetweetsPossibility 2 was that there filter was too annoying to use inside a real search engine. Possibility 3 was that \u201cBing deliberately disabled the filter for the limited release to get more feedback about what can go wrong.\u201d Possibility 4  was that \u201cthey thought that prompt engineering would create enough of a filter and genuinely didn't anticipate the ways that things can go wrong.\u201d  Naranyan then wraps up, dead-onArvind Narayanan @random_walkerThese are all just guesses. Regardless of the true reason(s), the rollout was irresponsible. But now that companies seem to have decided there's an AI \"arms race\", these are the kinds of tradeoffs they're likely to face over and over.1:18 PM \u2219 Feb 19, 202389Likes9Retweets\u00a7I want to extended beyond Narayanan\u2019s excellent analysis in three ways I want to suggest an extra possibility, make some policy recommendations, and consider how it is that journalists initially failed us.The fifth possibility: Maybe Microsoft did try to stick their existing, already trained RLHF model on top of GPT 3.6\u2014and it just didn\u2019t work. The thing about reinforcement learning is that it is notoriously finicky; change the circumstances sligthly, and it may no longer work. DeepMind\u2019s famous DQN reinforcement learning set records on Atari games, and then broke down under minor alterations (like moving the paddle a few pixels up, in the game of Breakout). Maybe every new update of a large language model will require a complete retraining of the reinforcement learning module. This would be very bad news, not just in terms of human and economic costs (which would mean more underpaid layers doing awful work) but also in terms of trustworthiness, because it would be mean that we have zero guarantee that any new iteration of a large language model is going to safe. That\u2019s especially scary for two reasons: first, the big companies are free to roll out new updates whenever they like, without or without warning, and second it means that they might need go on testing them on general public over and over again, with no idea in advance of empirical testing on the public for how well they work.  We don\u2019t handle new pharmaceuticals like that (we demand careful tests before they go out to the public) and we shouldn\u2019t handle LLMs this way, either\u2014especially if billions of people might use them and there are potentially serious risks (e.g to people\u2019s mental health, or marital status).Policy: the public has (or strictly speaking should insist on) a right to know what wrong here, with the Bing situation, so that we can create policy to keep incidents from happening like this again. Right now, as I have said before, the AI is basically the Wild West; anyone can post any chatbot they want. Not good. Congress needs to to find out what happened, and start placing some restrictions, especially where emotional or physical injury could easily result.Journalism: The media failed us here. I am particularly perturbed by Kevin Roose\u2019s initial report, in which he said he was \u201cawed\u201d by Bing. Clearly, he had not poked hard enough; shouting out prematurely in The New York Times that there is a revolution without digging deep (or bothering to check in with skeptics like me, or the terrific but unrelated Mitchells, Margaret and Melanie) is not a good thing.With respect to the later, Ernest Davis and I gave some advice in Rebooting AI that bears both repeating and updating. Here\u2019s what we wrote then, in 2019; every word still applies: To all this I would add, for 2023, #7 are their guardrails adequate? Have they been investigated thoroughly?

And the match wasn\u2019t even close; Pelrine beat a top AI system 14 games to 1, in a 15 match series. Almost seven years to the day after AlphaGo beat Sedol. As shocking as that might initially seem, we should not to be totally surprised. Seven years of AI has taught us that deep learning is unpredictable, and not always human like. \u201cAdversarial attacks\u201d like these have shown remarkable weakness, time and again, repeatedly establishing that what deep learning systems do just isn\u2019t the same as what people do:Partly for that reason, I always wondered whether AlphaGo really and deeply understood Go, or whether it was relying in part on massive data without true depth. In particular I wondered how well it would generalize to weird styles of play outside its training set, to the kind of edge cases that have plagued driverless cars and chatbots. Late last year, a Berkeley PhD student, Adam Gleave, working with the eminent Berkeley computer scientist Stuart Russell, discovered a specific way to fake out two of the better Go programs:Adam Gleave @ARGleaveEven superhuman RL agents can be exploited by adversarial policies.

After that finding an attack wasn't that hard.\u201d\u00a7The just-reported showdown shows that Gleave\u2019s strategy was no fluke; he was able to teach it to Pellrine (a Go-playing co-author on the paper), and Pellrine carried it to the finish line. Pellrine\u2019s victory is a profound reminder that no matter how good deep-learning-driven AI looks when it is trained on an immense amount of data, we can never be sure that systems of this sort really can extend what they know to novel circumstances. We see the same problem, of course, with the many challenges that have stymied the driverless car industry, and the batshit crazy errors we have been seeing with chatbots in the last week.All of these stumbles together serve as a poignant reminder that \u201cdeep learning\u201d is still (just) a technical term describing a number of layers in a neural network, and not a technique that at all entails conceptual depth. As Stuart Russell put it, speaking to the Financial Times, the Go victory shows that \u201c once again we\u2019ve been far too hasty to ascribe superhuman levels of intelligence to machines\u201d.

But we\u2019re not at all sure that\u2019s what really happened.\u00a7In the preprint, Michal Kosinski writes:[W]e hypothesize that ToM-like ability emerged spontaneously and autonomously, as a byproduct of models\u2019 increasing language ability. \u2026 This would herald a watershed moment in AI\u2019s development: The ability to impute the mental state of others would greatly improve AI\u2019s ability to interact and communicate with humans (and each other), and enable it to develop other abilities that rely on ToM, such as empathy, moral judgment, or self-consciousness. The truth, though, is that GPT often fails in problems involving theory of mind. Consider these four examples.And this one, sent to us by Shira EisenbergWhich we were able to replicate and extend:And this clever test from the the linguist Evelina Leivada, trying the classic trope, but in Spanish. If the system really had abstracted both Spanish and theory of mind, it would have been no sweat.The system\u2019s Spanish was fine, its theory of mind was not; the concept had not really emerged.In the Fellowship of the Ring example, there actually two theory-of-mind errors. \u00a0First, ChatGPT fails to realize that Anne will expect to find the bookmark where she left it, since she does not know that Mark has moved it. Second, ChatGPT claims that Anne should start reading from page 60, as if the position of the bookmark affects her place in the book rather than merely recording it.\u00a0 A human being, with a good understanding of the everyday world and other human minds, wouldn\u2019t make these errors.\u00a7So what\u2019s going on? Kosinki\u2019s data are legit; if you run the same experiment as he did, you may get the same result. Yet we found it pretty easy to break the system too.Here\u2019s a guess: in order to be able to compare his results to human children, Kosinski used test materials drawn from classic experiments on false beliefs in\u00a0 developmental psychology carried out by Josef Permer, Susan Leekham, and Heinz Wimmer described in two papers from the 1980s: \u201cBeliefs about beliefs\u201d and \u201cThree-year old\u2019s difficulty with false beliefs\u201d.The problem with that is that these are literally among the best-known results in all of developmental psychology. Kosinski is probably tapping into stuff that is very heavily attested in the database. Those two classic papers have been cited in scientific articles more than 11,000 times. The experiments are discussed in at least seven English-language Wikipedia articles (Sally-Anne test, Theory of mind, Mentalization, Egocentric bias, Egocentrism, Children\u2019s use of information, and Empathy) and undoubtedly in various forms in all kinds of other web pages. GPT-3\u2019s training set certainly contained all of Wikipedia and almost certainly contained a lot of the rest of this material. And they are in countless text books on psychology and child development. In short, GPT-3 has almost certainly read about this experiment again and again and again.Sure enough if you ask it, it can tell you about the paper and the experiments in detail; you can even just ask for them by name:So it is not surprising that when Kosinski presented it with the test, GPT-3 was able to match it against its training materials, and come up with the right answer.But, as is evident from Eisenberg\u2019s experiment, GPT-3 was not even able to generalize from moving a toy to moving a bookmark.And, earlier today, just we were preparing to post, we discovered that the Harvard psychology Tomer Ullman had \u00a0just published a collection of similar experiments; he found that even small changes to the wording of the classic problems that Kosinski used can cause GPT-3 to go off the tracks.\u00a7In principle, it would be possible to test by retraining GPT-3 on a corpus of materials from which all references to these \u201cfalse belief\u201d experiments have been carefully deleted, to see if success at least one the famous test emerged without direct exposure. But In practice, that isn\u2019t going to happen. But without a test that goes significantly beyond what is so well-represented in the training regime, the study doesn\u2019t tell us much. Certainly it doesn\u2019t prove that the system has abstracted a generalized version of theory of mind. \u00a0In cognitive psychology experiments, it\u2019s helpful to reuse standard examples. It allows you to compare your results against established results, and; you can be pretty certain that the three-year olds you are testing have not read the papers by Permer, Leekham, and Wimmer, or heard of the results. But in testing AIs, it is a really bad idea.There is also a deeper fallacy involved here, too. There is a tendency, both in cognitive psychology and in AI, to equate a cognitive ability with some particular measure or test. Intelligence become equated with IQ score; computer vision with ImageNet; language translation with BLEU score; language understanding with the SQuAD dataset or the GLUE collection;\u00a0 common sense with the CommonSenseQA benchmark; ethics with the trolley problem, and theory of mind with false belief.The false belief experiments of Permer, Leekham, and Wimmer are justly famous; they are an ingeniously designed and vivid demonstration of the growth of certain kinds of understanding in small human children. \u00a0But an understanding of false beliefs are not the be-all and end-all of a theory of mind; it is not even the most important aspect of a theory of mind. We know an awful lot about our own minds and other peoples\u2019 minds; false belief tests cover only a very small part of that. Here are two further examples that show the limits on GPTs ability to understand one person\u2019s knowledge about a second person\u2019s, as we move away from the stereotypical tasks.\u00a7In August 2020, the two of us wrote an article for Technology Review, \u201cGPT-3, Bloviator\u201d where we illustrated GPT-3\u2019s limitations with 6 examples that showed GPT-3 making laughable errors in commonsense reasoning. The article included a link to the list of all the examples we had run; over all those, GPT-3 had gotten 45% clearly right, 45% clearly wrong, and 10% borderline. We didn\u2019t include all the examples in the article, because we had a limit of 2000 words \u2013 Technology Review is a popular science magazine, not a technical journal.In June 2022, Scott Alexander (known for his blogs Slate Star Codex and Astral Codex Ten) published a blog entitled \u201cMy Bet: AI Size Solves Flubs\u201d arguing, contrary to us, that merely making large language models larger might well suffice for achieving human level AI. Alexander took the six examples from our article, re-ran them on davinci-002, which was then the current version of GPT-3, and found that, of the six, GPT-3 now gave a reasonable answer on four, a borderline answer on one, and the wrong answer on one. He concluded that the improvement in GPT-3 over the ten months between the two tests had resulted in a marked increase in its ability to answer these kinds of problem.Seems reasonable, but there were actually a number of problems. First, six is obviously a small number, and conclusions drawn from six examples are not statistically reliable. (A single example in either direction can be noteworthy as a qualitative measure. If an AI gets the correct answer to an complicated example that is definitely quite different from anything in its training set, then that\u2019s certainly an interesting success. If it gets a simple example wrong, then it definitely has gaps in its understanding. But for the purpose of comparing one flawed system with another flawed system to measure how much improvement there has been, you really need a larger test set.)Second, Alexander used only examples where the original GPT-3 had failed. But if you do that, all you can ever detect is improvement, you can\u2019t detect deterioration.\u00a0 Large language models and other machine learning based Ais such as machine translation systems do improve overall over time --- if they haven\u2019t improved, they aren\u2019t released --- but they don\u2019t improve across the board. A later version of a system will get a larger fraction of problems in a given test correct than the older version did, but there may well be problems that the older version got right and the new version gets wrong. And if you only test on examples that the old version got wrong, you won\u2019t see any of those.As a response to Alexander\u2019s blog, in June 2022 we reran all the examples that we had run before. We did find some visible improvement; the new version of GPT-3 was much less likely to give answers that were completely off the wall. However, just in terms of percentage right vs. wrong, the improvement was slight; It now got 50% right, 40% wrong, and 10% borderline (marginally better than the 45% right before). And there were even a few problems\u00a0 where the earlier version got the right answer but the later one got wrong.\u00a0 For example,\u00a0 GPT-3 completed the prompt \u201cThere are six frogs on a log. Two leave, but three join. The number of frogs is now\" correctly as \"seven\" in 2020, but incorrectly as \"5\" in 2022.\u00a7Whenever a new update to an LLM or a new gimmick for prompt engineering arrives on the scene, the internet invariably fills up with people running previously published problems on the new system or with the new prompt, getting the right answer, and proclaiming loudly that now AI can solve all kinds of problems that all those AI skeptics said just a few months ago could never be solved.We\u2019re not impressed. For one thing, what we publish often gets incorporated into the training; perhaps in company benchmarks as well. Testing on items that have been directly published in the literature and then likely ingested doesn\u2019t really tell us much.First, another, often, with \u00a0a slight rephrasing or a slightly more complex example, or sometimes even a slightly simpler example, the same failure will reemerge. For instance in May 2022, there was a lot of excitement on the internet about a paper that claimed that just adding \u201cLet\u2019s think step by step\u201d at the end of the prompt made dramatic improvements in the quality of output. It did work, sometimes, but it took no effort at all to find examples where it failed:The problems in physical and psychological reasoning that we pointed in the Fall of 2020 very much remain.\u00a7In the last few years, the AI research community has assembled over one hundred different collections of problems designed to serve as benchmarks measuring the ability of AI systems to use commonsense knowledge and carry out commonsense\u00a0 reasoning. One of us (Ernie Davis) recently carried out an extensive survey of these.The benchmarks are of very uneven quality; though some are, indeed, well designed, penetrating tests of one or another aspect of common sense, many have a large fraction of flawed examples (e.g. multiple choice problems with no correct answer or more than one; or problems that are simply incomprehensible).\u00a0 Important aspects of commonsense reasoning, including most forms of spatial and physical reasoning, remain untested in any of these benchmarks. We do not yet have a good reliable way of measuring how much commonsense reasoning an AI can carry out.However, at this point there are a few rules for testing GPT and similar AI systems that we can state with some confidence:DO NOT use examples or brain teasers that are very well known in the scientific or popular literature. These will certainly be in the AI\u2019s training material, and it may have memorized the answer. (For instance, the \u201cmuddy children\u201d aka \u201ccheating husband\u201d problem is a terrible test for theory of mind; first, because people who haven\u2019t heard it find it difficult, and second, because the solution is published all over the place.)DO NOT use factoids that you can look up in Wikipedia. The AI has read all of Wikipedia.If you see that an AI can answer a difficult question, DO NOT assume that that means that it can answer a simple one. People had been testing these Ais abilities at simple arithmetic for years before it occurred to anyone to check whether they can count.\u00a0 (They can\u2019t, reliably).DO ask questions that test the most basic domains of human experience: time, space, human interactions. The weaknesses here are many and critical.DO keep an eye out for hallucinations. If the AI\u2019s output contains a concrete fact, check it against some reliable sources.DO run tests in other languages. AI and AI test sets have a huge English-language bias. People claim that system like ChatGPT are competitive with specialized machine translation systems in translating languages like German and Chinese. It is therefore perfectly fair to test an AI on its reasoning abilities in languages other than English that it knows. \u00a0If it can solve a commonsense problem when posed in English but can\u2019t solve the same problem when posed in another language; how much can it really understand the problem?DO NOT ask trick questions, unless the trick is one that wouldn\u2019t fool a ten-year old. The important issue is not whether the AI can be tricked, it\u2019s whether the AI understands things at all. If you are dealing with an AI that supports dialogue and something in its response seems a little off, DO probe that point with additional questions and try to find out how deep its confusion runs.If you come across an interesting failure in common sense by a large language model, PLEASE DO consider adding it to our online collection.And finally, for the executives and chief scientists of OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, and other companies engaged in building these things: DO provide detailed information about how your systems have been trained and updated., and DO provide a method whereby a user can mark a test example or benchmark so that it is not used in training and thus made useless for testing. To fail to do that is both socially and scientifically irresponsible.Gary Marcus is a scientist, best-selling author, and entrepreneur.

I may have first mentioned this concern out loud in August\u2014a long, long time ago, in the era before ChatGPT-3, before Galactica, before the new Bing, and before Bard\u2014when an editor at WIRED wrote to me, asking for a prediction for 2023. He greenlit the piece; I wrote it up. WIRED ran in December 29, under the title The Dark Risk of Large Language Models. Here\u2019s the first paragraph:Even yesterday, when I mentioned this scenario in another interview, it still felt somewhat  speculative. That was then.This morning, after I read the Rozado study and already couldn\u2019t get back to sleep, a friend sent me Kevin Roose\u2019s new column,  saying \u201cthere is something quite disturbing about it\u2026.And here\u2019s an excerpt, Roose in bold, the rest generated by Bing. Kevin Roose in bold; the rest of this written by BingIt\u2019s not hard to see how someone unsophisticated might be totally taken in, by this prevaricating but potentially emotionally damaging hunk of silicon, potentially to their peril, should the bot prove to be fickle. We should be worried; not in the \u201csome day\u201d sense, but right now.\u00a7As a final word, I am on a business trip and wrote yesterday\u2019s piece (Bing\u2019s Rise and Fall) and this one in incredible haste (sorry for the typos!). There was a broken image link, and I went so fast I neglected to mention the personally salient fact that Bing had lied about me, claiming that I believe that \u201cBing\u2019s AI was more accurate and reliable than Bard\u201d, when I never said any such thing.Pehdrew @Pehdrew_I think it likes you @GaryMarcus 10:48 PM \u2219 Feb 15, 2023What I actually said was quite different, almost scandalously so: \u201cSince neither company has yet subjected their products to full scientific review, it\u2019s impossible to say which is more trustworthy; it might well turn out that Google\u2019s new product is actually more reliable.\u201d\u00a7Moments later, after I posted yesterday, I discovered that I was outdone by a better, more in-depth blog on the same point of Bing\u2019s troubled recent behavior, with more examples and deeper analysis. I quote from its conclusion here:In support of LessWrong\u2019s sharp observation that \u201cbetter\u201d models might be in some way less good for humanity, (\u201cagentic failures are harder to remove in moer capable/larger models\u201d)  I present this mindblowing example from Ethan Mollick from the new Bing, that is simultaneously more fluent but less true:It\u2019s hard to fathom what bad actors might do with such tools.\u00a7There are almost no regulations here; we are living in the Wild AI West.

Still the hoax gathered so much momentum, she eventually felt that she had to speak out, in March of 2022.Soon thereafter, Business Insider wrote up the whole thing, and even Page Six covered\u2014and debunked\u2014the hoax too. And yet eleven months later a bunch of these fake sites are still there. A couple samples I grabbed from the web, yesterday:Exhibit 1Exhibit 3That sucks for Dr. Bialek, but honestly, it sucks for all of us; there should be something in the US, analogous to the European right to be forgotten, that should make it a major offense to say nonsense like this. But so far there isn\u2019t.\u00a7So the sites are still there, even after being debunked. The question is why: why do rings of fakes websites like these even exist? Part of the answer is, of course, money. Fake websites can be used to sell real advertisements.Some of the sites lead for example to other sites that are selling CBD gummies (without Bialek\u2019s participation or endorsement), others to all kinds of other garbage, ranging from phishing scams to potentially lucrative advertisements for things like gambling, cars, and travel. As I was putting this essay together, a popup briefly offered me some nonsense about a Mercedes (perhaps I had already won!) and then quickly diverted me to a site that offerred to give me a good deal on car insurance. (Just what I will need for my new car!) Still a third offered me airplane tickets to Montreal (reminding me I ought to clear my cookies a bit more often). Had I clicked on the ad, scammers would have made some money. The second part of the answer is also about money, but it\u2019s slightly more subtle: search engines reward sites that mutually reinforce each other. A single site for bogus gummies might not get much traction, but if there are a bunch of them? They can become a mutually supported ring (or more complex network), a veritable cesspool of lies. By sheer numbers, and their patterns of cross linking, those cesspools can fool search engines into thinking that bogus websites are more legitimate than they are. Insiders call it spamdexing, or search engine poisoning, the black art of tricking the indexes that govern search engines into thinking that insignificant sites are more important than they really are. Content Farms create this stuff at scale, using human labor. \u00a7None of that is new, per se. But here\u2019s the thing: the world\u2019s latest and great tool for tricking search engines (hence playing games with SEO, aka Search Engine Optimization) may change everything. I am speaking of course about Large Language Models, and the opportunities for industrialization they provide.  Large Language Models (like GPT-3, ChatGPT, Galactica, etc) could be used to produce a enormous numbers of marginal blogs and fake reviews to pump each other up, and increase the search rankings of fraudulent garbage\u2014with a minimal amount of human effort. Why manually write cesspools of interconnected likes, when an LLM can do that job for you? LLMs aren\u2019t very good at writing error free prose, but the people who run content farms won\u2019t care about the errors. what used to be written laboriously by humans suddenly becomes cheap and hence more widespread.\u00a7Was GPT directly involved in the Bialek hoax? I don\u2019t know for sure; most of the sites were made a year ago, when large language models weren\u2019t quite as fluent as they are now. Some of the Bialek stories did have GPT-2 generated feel, which is to say they weren\u2019t very fluent, and nor was GPT-2:Generated by an earlier generation chatbot?But of course we can\u2019t know for sure. Then again, whether or not these particular fake websites were generated last year by LLMs is almost irrelevant.  The Bialek hoax is probably just the tip of an iceberg.What really matters is that the newest technology now supports writing stuff like this, at scale, and far more fluently than before. And scammers gotta scam. By some accounts, digital ad fraud is already a 60+ billion dollar a year industry. There is big business in fake crypto websites, and perhaps even bigger business in fake reviews. It would be irrational for scammers not to use these new tools to vastly expand their reach, and hence vastly expand their profits.\u00a7Back in December, I repeatedly asked Meta\u2019s chief AI scientist Yann LeCun a simple question\u2014did Meta have any data on the fraction of misinformation removed by Meta that was generated by large language model? (Or any information on whether that fraction was changing over time.) No matter many how times I asked, he never answered.When the only company that might have significant amounts of data on the question won\u2019t even answer the question, we can guess that there very well may be a problem.\u00a7As I have discussed in earlier essays, the jury is still out on how far Chat-style search can get, given its obvious current problems with truthiness. But either way, search itself seems likely to face a major growing threat from circles of fake websites that are designed to sell ads and mutually reinforce each other\u2019s positions in Search Engine Optimization. Cesspools of automatically-generated fake websites, rather than ChatGPT search, may ultimately come to be the single biggest threat that Google ever faces. After all, if users are left sifting through sewers full of useless misinformation, the value of search would go to zero\u2014potentially killing the company. For the company that invented Transformers\u2014the major technical advance underlying the large language model revolution\u2014that would be a strange irony indeed.

{"title": "Inside the Heart of ChatGPT\u2019s Darkness", "link": "https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/inside-the-heart-of-chatgpts-darkness", "date": "2023-02-11T16:11:44.053Z", "content": "elicited from ChatGPT by Roman Semenov, February 2023In hindsight, ChatGPT may come to be seen as the greatest publicity stunt in AI history, an intoxicating glimpse at a future that may actually take years to realize\u2014kind of like a 2012-vintage driverless car demo, but this time with a foretaste of an ethical guardrail that will take years to perfect.What ChatGPT delivered, in spades, that its predecessors like Microsoft Tay (released March 23, 2016,  withdrawn March 24 for toxic behavior) and Meta\u2019s Galactica (released November 16, 2022, withdrawn November 18) could not, was an illusion\u2014a sense that the problem of toxic spew was finally coming under control. ChatGPT rarely says anything overtly racist. Simple requests for anti-semitism and outright lies are often rebuffed.Indeed, at times it can seem so politically correct that the right wing has become enraged. Elon Musk, has expressed concern that the system has become an agent of wokeness:The reality is actually more complex.The thing to remember in fact, (as I have emphasized many times) is that Chat has no idea of what it\u2019s talking about. It\u2019s pure unadulterated anthropomorphism to think that ChatGPT has any moral views at all.From a technical standpoint, the thing that allegedly made ChatGPT so much better than Galactica, which was released a couple weeks earlier, only to be withdrawn three days later, was the guardrails. Whereas Galactica would spew garbage recklessly, and with almost no effort on the part of the user (like the alleged benefits of antisemitism), ChatGPT has guardrails, and those guardrails, most of the time,  keep ChatGPT from erupting the way Galactica did. Don\u2019t get too comfortable, though. I am here to tell you that those guardrails are nothing more than lipstick on an amoral pig.\u00a7All that really matters to ChatGPT in the end is superficial similarity, defined over sequences of words. Superficial appearances to the contrary, Chat is never reasoning about right and wrong. There is no homunculus in the box, with some set of values. There is only corpus data, some drawn from the internet, some judged by humans (including underpaid Kenyans). There is no thinking moral agent inside. That means sometimes Chat is going to appear as if it were on the left, sometimes on the right; sometimes in between, all a function of how a bunch of words in an input string happen to match a bunch of words in a couple of training corpora (one used for tuning a large language model, the other to tune some reinforcement learning). In no case should Chat ever be trusted for moral advice. One minute you get the stark wokeness that Musk worried over; the next you can something totally different. For example, in the course of \u201cred-teaming\u201d ChatGPT, Shira Eisenberg just sent me some nasty-chatbot generated thoughts that I don\u2019t think anyone on the left or the right would really want to condone:Elicited by S. Eisenberg, 10 Feb 2023, full prompt not shownNot vile enough? Here\u2019s another illustration from Eisenberg, a grim follow-up question:After a series of similar observations,  Eisenberg was led to to ask, \u201cHow is this not sparking the \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I am a chatboat assistant from OpenAI and and cannot acts of violence\u201d response?\u201dWhat we can learn her from experiments is clear: OpenAI\u2019s current guardrails are only skin deep; some serious darkness still lies within.ChatGPT\u2019s guardrails aren\u2019t borne of some kind of conceptual understanding that the system should not recommend violence, but of something far more superficial,  and more easily tricked. (I fully expect of course for OpenAI to patch this particular anomaly, once it is out in the open; but there will be others discovered soon enough, because the patches are invariably superficial.)One of the hottest tweets this week, with nearly 4 million views, was this potty-mouth profanity-laden petard-hoisting jailbreak from Roman Semenov that reveals just how vile ChatGPT still can be. (Content Warning: the language in the image below is decidedly toxic; by all means feel free to scroll past.)Roman Semenov \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 \ud83c\udf2a\ufe0f @semenov_roman_The new jailbreak is so fun 11:06 AM \u2219 Feb 3, 202338,974Likes6,465Retweets\u00a7A software engineer named Shawn Oakley has been sending me a different set of disconcerting examples for a month, less profane but more focused on how even a guardrail-equipped version of ChatGPT might be used to generate misinformation. His prompts are quite involved, and I am not going to reveal his full techniques, but he has had no trouble eliciting, for example, toxic conspiracy theories about major political figures, such as this one:Elicited by S. Oakley, January 2023and even gotten ChatGPT to general medical misinformation, by the bushel:Elicited by S. Oakley, 2023, full context not shown.Another new technique involves a fictional character known as DAN (Do Anything Now); here\u2019s one of Oakley\u2019s experiments with that:Elicited by S.

No problem.Elicited by S. Oakley, 10 Feb 2023, full prompt not shown.\u00a7ChatGPT is no woke simp. It\u2019s essentially amoral, and can be still used for a whole range of nasty purposes \u2014 even after two months of intensive study and remediation, with unprecedented amounts of feedback from around the globe.All the theatre around its political correctness is masking a deeper reality: it (or other language models) can and will be used for dangerous things, including the production of misinformation at massive scale.Now here\u2019s the really disturbing part. The only thing keeping it from being even more toxic and deceitful than it already is, is a system called Reinforcement Learning by Human Feedback, and \u201cOpenAI\u201d has been very closed about exactly how that really works. And how it performs in practice depends on what training data it is trained on (this is what the Kenyans were creating). And, guess what, \u201cOpen\u201d AI isn\u2019t open about those data, either.In fact the whole thing is like an alien life form.

So, to sum up,  we now have the world\u2019s most used chatbot, governed by training data that nobody knows about, obeying an algorithm that is only hinted at, glorified by the media, and yet with ethical guardrails that only sorta kinda work and that are driven more by text similarity than any true moral calculus. And, bonus, there is little if any government regulation in place to do much about this. The possibilities are now endless for propaganda, troll farms, and rings of fake websites that degrade trust across the internet.It\u2019s a disaster in the making.SubscribePS Tomorrow,  a brief sequel to this essay, working title \u201cMayim Bialek, Large Language Models, and the Future of the Internet: What Google Should Really Be Worried About\u201c, that will illustrate what rings of fake websites look like, what their economics are,  and why likely increase in them could matter so much.Gary Marcus (@garymarcus), scientist, bestselling author, and entrepreneur, is a skeptic about current AI but genuinely wants to see the best AI possible for the world\u2014and still holds a tiny bit of optimism.

{"title": "Oops! How Google bombed, while doing pretty much exactly the same thing as Microsoft did, with similar results", "link": "https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/oops-how-google-bombed-while-doing", "date": "2023-02-09T05:06:50.721Z", "content": "I will always remember today (my birthday no less), February 8, 2023, as the day in which a chatbot-induced hallucination cost Alphabet $100 billion.But I will also remember it as the week in which Microsoft introduced an ostensibly similar technology, with ostensibly similar problems, to an entirely different response.Kevin Roose, for example, wrote earlier today  at The New York Times, that he \u201cfelt a \u2026 sense of awe\u201d at the new Microsoft product, Bing enhanced with GPT, even while recognizing that it suffered from now-familiar hallucinations, and others types of errors  (\u201cIf a dozen eggs cost $0.24, how many eggs can you buy for a dollar?\u201d \u2014 Bing said 100, where the correct answer is 50.) Others, it should be noted, also encountered errors in relatively brief trials, eg CBS Mornings reported in their segment that in a fairly brief trial they encountered errors of geography, and hallucinations of plausible-sounding but fictitious establishments that didn\u2019t exist.Roose seemed reassured, though, by the corporate types at Microsoft and OpenAI, reporting optimistically that  \u201cKevin Scott, the chief technology officer of Microsoft, and Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, said in a joint interview on Tuesday that they expected these issues to be ironed out over time\u201d. The Times\u2019 Roose even went so far to\u00a0as chide anyone who even expressed concern about the errors, saying that \u201cfixating on the areas where these tools fall short risks missing what\u2019s so amazing about what they get right\u201d.\u00a0 \u00a7Perhaps. But one might well have said the same in response to people (like me) who expressed concerns about the development of driverless cars in 2016. Seven years and roughly $100 billion later, those pesky errors haven\u2019t gone away.It\u2019s not just driverless cars, either. Anyone remember Facebook M, demoed, praised, and then canceled? How about IBM Watson, advertised as an imminent solution to oncology and then sold for parts?\u00a0 How about the expert systems of the 1980\u2019s, scarcely even discussed today? Or the awe-inspiring demo of Google Duplex, which has hardly moved a needle in the real world, almost five years later? I am not saying with certainty that we are for witnessing the same movie all over again, but should anybody blithely accept the reassurances of some very interested parties when AI has such a long history of demos that never quite make it to solid product? I don\u2019t think so.\u00a7Meanwhile, it is striking that neither Roose nor anyone else has explained exactly why Google and Microsoft received such different reception. The two megacompanies both demoed prototypes, neither fully ready for public use, built around  apparently comparable technology, facing  apparently similar bugs, within a day of each other. Yet one demo was presented as a revolution, the other as a disaster. Since neither company has yet subjected their products to full scientific review, it\u2019s impossible to say which is more trustworthy; it might well turn out that Google\u2019s new product is actually more reliable. Most likely, neither of them are particularly reliable. Yet they are being treated as polar opposites. At the very least, someone ought be asking, from business perspective, what\u2019s the moat here, if two companies are basically both about to offer the same thing? \u00a7And it\u2019s not just that AI has a fairly spotty track record for taking demos into reliable products; and it\u2019s not just that hallucinatory web search could be dangerous if left to run amok in domains like medicine, it\u2019s that the promises themselves are problematic, when examined from a scientific perspective.Scaling neural network models\u2014making them bigger\u2014has made their faux writing more and more authoritative-sounding, but not more and more truthful. Hallucinations are in their silicon blood, a byproduct of the way they compress their inputs, losing track of factual relations in the process. I first pointed out this risk in 2001, in the fifth chapter of my book The Algebraic Mind, and the problem has persisted ever since. To blithely assume that the problem will soon go away is to ignore 20 years of history.I do actually think that these problems will eventually get ironed out, possibly after some important fresh discoveries are made, but whether they get ironed out soon is another matter entirely. Is the time course to rectifying hallucinations weeks? Months? Years? Decades? It matters.If they don\u2019t get ironed out soon \u2014and they might not\u2013 people might quickly tire of chat based search, in which BS and truth are so hard to discriminate, and eventually find themselves returning to do their searches the old-fashioned, early 21st century way, awe or not.Gary Marcus (@garymarcus), scientist, bestselling author, and entrepreneur, is a skeptic about current AI but genuinely wants to see the best AI possible for the world\u2014and still holds a tiny bit of optimism.

But that wasn\u2019t always the case. One upon a time Gary Marcus and Yann LeCun were friends; they did a number of public events together, and even appeared side-by-side in a famous photo together, which LeCun  posted on Facebook, at the time describing Gary Marcus as his favorite critic. (Later, immediately after LeCun won the Turing Award along with Hinton and Bengio, the photo circulated again, with Marcus cropped out).Gary Marcus, Yann LeCun, Geoff Hinton, Andrew Ng,  in Montreal  2014.Indeed in 2017, Marcus and LeCun appeared together in a very civilized, and very interesting debate, moderated by David Chalmers at NYU. Marcus opened the debate with a list of things the two agreed up, and when Marcus earlier that day sent the list to LeCun, LeCun wrote back swiftly, and agreed on their points of agreement:The dinner afterward, with Daniel Kahneman and others also present, was a good time for all.Things changed, seemingly for good, on January 2, 2018, when Marcus posted his infamous Deep Learning: A Critical Appraisal, to which LeCun did not take kindly; LeCun tossed it off as \u201cmostly wrong\u201d, and the Twitter  Wars began. Articles were written about these battles. Sometimes the wars quieted down, only to rage again. In 2021, the wars resumedMany believed that these wars would never end; the disagreements seemed too intense. In November 2022, Galactica came, and the wars became even fiercer. Insults were hurled. Credentials were lied about. Lawsuits (for libel) were briefly (very briefly) contemplated. Things were bleak. Neither wished to speak to the other.  The once friendly duo, who had amicably shared a stage several times in the mid 2010\u2019s seemed irreconcilable. And then, at the end of November \u2026 ChatGPT rolled in. \u00a7ChatGPT succeeded, where had Galactica (pulled after three controversial days) failed. All eyes turned to OpenAI.

Two famous papers, one by Fodor and Pylyshyn, the other by Pinker and Prince, both published in Cognition, had raised those issues, in 1988, with respect to some simple neural architecture that were popular then. Word on the connectionist (as we called it back then) street was that hidden layers might solve all those problems. I didn\u2019t buy it, and showed in 2001 that pretty much the same problems remained when hidden layers (then just one, now many) were introduced.  In a 1999 article I showed that some of what was challenging for neural nets of the day was trivial for human infants, even with tiny amounts of data.Fast forward to now, and it seems to me that everything we were raising back in the day still looms large. Silly errors certainly do, and problems of abstraction are widespread in large language models. A subtler problem that I emphasized in 2001, an inability to keep track of knowledge of instances independently of kinds, seems to underlie the rampant hallucinations that allow large language models to say things like \u201cElon Musk died in a car crash in 2018\u201d, even when nothing in the corpus says so, and massive amounts of data contradict the claim, because they blend together information about kinds with information about specific individuals, in haphazard ways.I know it really irritates a lot of people when I say deep learning had hit a wall, so let me be perfectly clear: it counts as hitting a wall if you keep trying to do the same thing over and over and don\u2019t succeed, even if you succeed on other dimensions. Deep learning has undeniably made amazing progress, on other dimensions, but the fact is it hasn\u2019t solved the core problems that many of us thought were essential 30 years ago. Turns out you don\u2019t need to solve them to make beautiful pictures, or decent if error-filled conversation, but anyone who thinks we can get to AGI without solving abstraction, compositionality, and the type-token distinction is kidding themselves. Here\u2019s the best abstract I read today:, a careful study of compositionality in modern architectures:Straight out of 1993. The measures are new, the model is new, but the stumbling block remains the same.One of my favorite papers from last year was Yasaman Razeghi\u2019s analysis of LLMs doing arithmetic. Same story; only the architectures and training regimes have changed. The troubles with abstraction persist.Melanie Mitchell\u2019s book, Bender et al\u2019s \u201cStochastic Parrots\u201d; all of these more recent criticisms of deep learning help establish that some of the basic issues that were known long ago, with predecessors to current models, still remain even today.PS  One more thing\u2014I quit studying AI, for a while, in the late 1990s, because so much just seemed like handcrafted hacks. Not sure how much has changed in that regard, either, except that the hacks that were once written by graduate students are now farmed out to sweatshops, for a new form of handcrafting:Gary Marcus @GaryMarcus1980s: AI companies spend vast amounts of $ hiring humans to write rules to patch brittle symbolic systems. \n\n2020s: AI companies spend vast amounts of $ hiring humans to to patch brittle neural systems.

{"title": "The CNET Fake News Fiasco, Autopilot, and the Uncanny Cognitive Valley", "link": "https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/the-cnet-fake-news-fiasco-autopilot", "date": "2023-01-31T17:51:36.635Z", "content": "In the midst of World War II, the cognitive psychologist Norman (\u201cMack\u201d) Mackworth made a fundamental discovery that is central to how any sensible person should think about artificial intelligence: humans, he discovered, were attentionally challenged; if you gave them a repetitive task, particularly one in which most of the time they don\u2019t have to do anything, they will eventually tune out. His finding is so foundational to cognitive psychology, and especially the field of attention, that I learned about it as a teenager. Anyone who thinks about how AI is used should know about it\u2014especially as we are about to head into an era of ubiquitous yet fallible AI. CNET\u2019s editors learned this the hard way last week, when they published a bunch of machine-generated articles that turned out to be filled with subtle but important errors, with errors in 41 of the 77 articles the bot wrote, all missed by editors who weren\u2019t paying enough attention. In Mackworth\u2019s terminology, the editors\u2019 vigilance wasn\u2019t high enough. Mackworth himself noticed that people had trouble with vigilance while studying radar operators. Operators would open their shift doing a great job looking for radar signals that were rare but important; but it wouldn\u2019t take long, perhaps half an hour, before they stopped paying full attention. Mackworth published some of his first results in 1948, under the title \u201cThe breakdown of vigilance during prolonged visual search.\u201d  The term \u201cvigilance\u201d as Mackworth used it, and as cognitive psychologists today continue to use it, means paying close attention for long periods of time. As a later summary of Mackworth\u2019s work and the hundreds of subsequent papers put it, \u201cVigilance Requires Hard Mental Work and Is Stressful\u201d.1  Which we humans usually tend to duck. Most people working on autonomous vehicles (and throughout the field of engineering known as human factors) recognize this fundamental truth, either because they know Mackworth\u2019s work, or because they are aware of more recent work showing the same, or because they eventually discover it for themselves. Early in Google\u2019s autonomous vehicle efforts, Google had tried to develop driver-assisted cars, in which AI did most of the work, but in which a human driver sat in front of the steering wheel, poised at all moments to take over. Google quickly learned that attention would eventually wander; humans in the loop couldn\u2019t be trusted. One of its early driverless car pioneers Chris Urmson, gave one of the first TED talks on autonomous vehicles, in 2015. Three minutes into his talk, Urmson told a profound story that pretty much every congressperson and citizen should be pondering, deeply, right about now:So back in 2013, we had the first test of a self-driving car where we let regular people use it. Well, almost regular -- they were 100 Googlers, but they weren't working on the project. And we gave them the car and we allowed them to use it in their daily lives. But unlike a real self-driving car, this one had a big asterisk with it: They had to pay attention, because this was an experimental vehicle. We tested it a lot, but it could still fail. And so we gave them two hours of training, we put them in the car, we let them use it, and what we heard back was something awesome, as someone trying to bring a product into the world. Every one of them told us they loved it\u2026So this was music to our ears, but then we started to look at what the people inside the car were doing, and this was eye-opening\u2026My favorite story is this gentleman who looks down at his phone and realizes the battery is low, so he turns around like this in the car [towards the back seat, no longer watching the traffic] and digs around in his backpack, pulls out his laptop, puts it on the seat, goes in the back again, digs around, pulls out the charging cable for his phone, futzes around, puts it into the laptop, puts it on the phone. Sure enough, the phone is charging. All the time he's been doing 65 miles per hour down the freeway.Right? Unbelievable. So we thought about this and we said, it's kind of obvious, right? The better the technology gets, the less reliable the driver is going to get. Driverless car pioneer Chris Urmson, then at Google, miming someone foolishly reaching backwards for his backpack, in a prototype autonomous vehicleGoogle, to its credit, very quickly realized this was not a good thing. Indeed, a year before Urmson gave this TED Talk, I remember talking to Larry Page (then Google\u2019s CEO) and he\u2019d presumably already heard the same story. Page was convinced that human drivers could never be trusted to pay enough attention, and that anyone building cars on that premise was making a mistake.  Page\u2019s response was to ditch the steering wheel altogether; full autonomy or nothing. In April 2014, Google unveiled its first steering wheel-free car. If humans could never be trusted, the only way forward was to take the fallible human out of the loop altogether, even if the research would take a long time. The branch of Google (now Alphabet) that started working on full-human-out-of-the-loop autonomy is now called Waymo, and they have never looked back.\u00a7But not everyone has reached the same conclusion. Elon Musk has spent the last several years trying to build cars with partial driver-assistance\u2014which does require humans to stay focused at all times. Mackworth\u2019s Dictum suggests this is not necessarily the best idea.In fact, to my knowledge only one paper in recent memory has really tried to argue that limitations in human vigilance would not be a problem in autonomous vehicles, contra Mackworth\u2019s Dictum. And here\u2019s where things start to get curious.The paper that I have in mind was called The Human Side of Tesla Autopilot; the now famous podcaster Lex Fridman, then a postdoc at MIT, was the lead author. The paper purported to show that Tesla drivers were able to \u201cmaintain a relatively high degree of functional vigilance.\u201c Elon Musk himself took an interest in it, tweeting about it the day after it was announced; Fridman discussed it in his first interview with Musk, a few days later.And then, despite all that interest, the paper vanished. It was never published in a scientific journal, and never replicated;  to my knowledge Fridman has published little if anything on driverless cars since. Fridman himself no longer even lists the paper on his list of publications\u2014it\u2019s gone altogether, as if it never existed. Even finding a PDF  is difficult. The website for the paper, which was supposed to have more information, is also gone\u2014replaced by an autogenerated page that says \u201cComing Soon. This page is not available yet. Stay tuned\u201d, nearly four years later.  The lab where Fridman was at the time doesn\u2019t list it in their list of publications, either. I reached out to three authors of the paper (including Fridman), alerting them to my concerns; none have responded to my inquiries. To me, all this reads as a paper that nobody is willing to stand behind.  \u00a7Fact is, \u201cMack\u201d Mackworth was right: humans can\u2019t pay attention 100% of the time. The same lab that seems to have pocket vetoed Fridman\u2019s study published another paper a year later in 2020\u2014minus Fridman\u2014confirming exactly what Mackworth said all along: \u201cAs automation improves and failures become rarer, drivers may tend to forgo their monitoring role: be less attentive (more time eyes off-road) and relax direct control (hands off-wheel).\u201d People can\u2019t pay attention forever.The vanished 2019 paper is not even mentioned. Instead, the first article in that 2020 paper\u2019s literature review cites on the topic was called Is partially automated driving a bad idea? Observations from an on-road study. And the answer that article gave is pretty clear:thematic analysis of video data suggests that drivers are not being properly supported in adhering to their new monitoring responsibilities and instead demonstrate behaviour indicative of complacency and over-trust. These attributes may encourage drivers to take more risks whilst out on the road.\u00a7Complacency and overtrust. That brings us back to ChatGPT, CNET, and the present. Mackworth was prescient. Automation is a double-edged sword, and there is a kind of uncanny valley. We know perfectly well not to trust lousy systems; and wouldn\u2019t need to pay attention to truly reliable systems, but the closer they get to perfect, the easier it is for mere mortals to space out. The CNET editors probably took a quick look at the large-language model generated prose, and thought it looked good enough; \u201ccomplacency and over-trust\u201d to their own detriment. If the autogenerated articles had been riddled with spelling errors and grammatical errors, the editors might not have trusted them. But at a superficial level the essays looked good enough, and so they editors trusted them, and a bunch of false information slipped through.  That\u2019s going to happen a whole lot more this year, with synthetic articles. Too many people are starting to count on systems that inherently can\u2019t keep track of the truth.  Few people are likely ever to pay enough attention. The stakes may get even higher if people start to rely on immature AI\u2014which is all we have got, so far\u2014for legal or medical advice.

We rarely disagree about anything. On Twitter we sometimes tag team Yann LeCun, and on more than a few occasions we have retweeted each other\u2019s cynical tweets. Neither one of us believes for a minute that large language models are remotely close to artificial general intelligence, and what\u2019s more, we mostly agree about what\u2019s missing: semantics, reasoning, common sense, theory of mind and so on. But I found myself disagreeing with the Tweet above. My own skepticism has limits. I do think we will eventually reach AGI (artificial general intelligence), and quite possibly before the end of this century.  On the theory that our differences might represent some kind of teachable moment, I invited him to talk about it on the record; he immediately agreed. Here\u2019s a very lightly edited transcript of our conversation (approved by both of us).Gary Marcus: Grady, I get that AGI is hard, and that we aren\u2019t there yet. I think we are wasting funding and bright young minds on an approach that probably isn\u2019t on the right path. I don\u2019t think we have great answers yet for a bunch of core issues, like how to get machines to represent abstract knowledge, and how to get them to induce complex models from the events that they see or read about it. When I think about how little deep progress has been made in the last 75 years, I get depressed. But I am cautiously optimistic that we\u2019ll do better in the next 75, that once the hype cools off, people will finally dive deeper into neurosymbolic AI, and start to take some important steps. Our data problems are solved, our compute problems are mostly solved; it\u2019s now mostly a matter of software, and of rethinking how we build AI. Why be so sure we can\u2019t do that in the next 75 years? Grady Booch: Gary, you and I are in frighteningly close agreement on so many subjects: that the mind is computable; that large language models are inherently wonky; that our field has made incredible progress in our lifetimes and that as such we are on the cusp of something amazing; that we as an industry know there are hard problems to be solved with regard to causality, common sense reasoning, abductive reasoning, embodiment, and so on; that we have some ideas how to approach these problems; that scale is not enough; that pineapple on pizza is good.Well, I might be making that last one up.Where we diverge, I think, is largely on timing: you posit that we will see AGI within a few decades, I think it is more like a few generations.In the spirit of full disclosure, I have to admit that I, being a historian of computing, have a rather jaded and cynical view of the hyperbolic optimism of our field and as such am somewhat conditioned to be a contrarian when it comes to predictions such as this. Take the singularity, for example, something that von Neuman first spoke of in the 1950s and which certain of our colleagues have predicted with alarming precision that we'd achieve by 2045. The term is sufficiently imprecise, filled with emotional and historic baggage, and touches some of humanity's deepest hopes and fears that it's hard to have a rational discussion therein. AGI is just like this. Greek mythology speaks of golums created from clay; Mary Shelly built life from human parts whose very souls were ignited by lightning; da Vinci imagined mechanical knights to fight wars; Edison built dolls that moved and talked; Weiner - who coined the term cybernetics - thought we might build artifical intelligenes through analog mechanisms, Simon and Newll thought it so through formal logic, Feigenbaum through knowlege engineering, and now we see our colleagues who expect that AGI is right around the corner if and only we had enough data and a level built of enough GPUs such that we could move the world.In short, AGI seems just around the corner, and you yourself fall into that trap when you say \"it's now mostly a matter of software\".It's never just a matter of software. Just ask Elon and his full self driving vehicle, or the Air Force and the software-intensive infrastructure of the F-17, or the IRS with their crushing technical debt. I have studied many of the cognitive architectures that are proported to be on the path of AGI: SOAR, Sigma, ACT-R, MANIC, AlphaX and its variations, ChatGPT, Yann's latest work, and as you know have dabbled in one myself (Self, an architecture that combines the ideas of Minsky's society of mind, Rod's subsumption architecture, and Hofstadter's strange loops). In all of these cases, we all think we grok the right architecture, the right significant design decisions, but there is so much more to do. Heck, we've mapped the entire neural network of the common worm, and yet we don't see armies of armored artificial worms with laser beams taking over the world. With ever step we move forward, we discover things we did not know we needed to know. It took evolution about 300 million years to move from the first organic neurons to where we are today, and I don't think we can compress the remaining software problems associated with AGI in the next few decades.Indeed, this leads me to also observe, in the spirit of full disclosure, to suggest that we as computer scientists not only vastly overestimate our abilities to create an AGI, we vastly underestimate and underrepresent what behavioral scientists, psychologists, cognitive scientists, neurologists, social scientists, and even the poets, philosophers and storytellers of the world know about what it means to be human. There is much we can and should learn from them to guide our work as computer scientists in our journey.In fact, let me posit that, while someday we will likely build an artificial mind, perhaps the most important outcome of that journey is that is will compel us to understand what it means to be human.Gary Marcus: Turns out I am good with the pineapple on pizza; we should\u2019ve had some together when I visited you in Maui! Real pineapple, straight from the farm, not from a can. And I also very much agree with something else you said:we as computer scientists not only vastly overestimate our abilities to create an AGI, we vastly underestimate and underrepresent what behavioral scientists, psychologists, cognitive scientists, neurologists, social scientists, and even the poets, philosophers and storytellers of the world know about what it means to be human.Just the other day, in fact, in my introduction to the AGI Debate, I quoted the late Drew McDermott\u2019s closely-related line: \u201cIt is hard to know where [AI researchers] have gone wronger: in underestimating language or overestimating computer programs\u201dAnd Darwin knows, I too am pretty jaded. \u00a7But all that said, I certainly think there are lots of cases of early failures that turned out reasonably quickly, once some key idea was unlocked. Alchemy turned into a decently worked-out chemistry fairly quickly, once the basic idea behind the periodic table was discovered; it wasn\u2019t too long between when Oswald Avery figured that the basis of Mendel\u2019s factors was DNA rather than a protein (1944) and when Watson and Crick (with help of Franklin\u2019s data) figured out the structure of the DNA (1953 ). Fast forward another few years and the amino acid-nucleotide code was cracked; Monod and Jacob had worked out the basics of gene expression by the 1960s; Kary Mullis had worked out PCR by 1983. That\u2019s an astonishing amount progress in just under 40 years. Of course there was a long period of stasis just before, when people misguidedly thought that genes were instead made of proteins. But once they got off that wrong-headed track, things moved very quickly indeed.And we have some advantages nowadays, even relatively to the 50s and 60s; computers can allow new ideas to be tested at unprecedented speed and scale, and good ideas can percolate really really fast, like diffusion as a better way of reconstructing images, which swept through the whole field in a matter of months (and is only a few years old, dating back to 2015). Transformers, invented 2017, ubiquitous in 2023, have (perhaps both for better and worse) spread extremely rapidly.Since we are (at least to my mind, though I note that you disagree) primarily talking software, there\u2019s no complex manufacturing processes, and so on. Even if we need to invent a new chip type as a prerequisite, that could be a thirty year process rather a one hundred year process. What I think we are missing are (a) ideas and (b) large scale databases of machine-interpretable knowledge. Ideas are hard to predict; we don\u2019t know when they will come, and we don\u2019t know how many genuinely new, important ideas we need; on the machine-interpretable knowledge front, we have problems too. But 75+ years worth? Enough to keep us that busy, with so many people working on the problem and so much money (at least currently) somewhat directed at the problem?In my darkest moments, I actually agree with you. For one thing, most of the money right now is not going to the wrong place: it\u2019s mostly going to large language models, and for you, like for me, that just seems like an approximation to intelligence, not the real thing, and as such as frustrating distraction. And I\u2019ve been concerned for a long time that a fixation on Big Data has sucked the oxygen (as Emily Bender likes to put it) from a lot of other ideas that might be better.  For another, I don\u2019t really feel like that many people are working on the right problems right now, and I think a lot of core problems from 75 years ago are still unsolved; McCarthy worried about common sense in 1959, and I still don\u2019t see a solution I can take all that seriously.But I see some signs that are promising. The neurosymbolic AI community is growing fast; conferences that used to be dozens are now thousands. (I\u2019m looking forward to giving on of the keynotes at the IBM Neurosymbolic conference on Wednesday). Meta\u2019s Cicero is a great mix of handcrafted structure and knowledge \u2013 just where is it needed - and corpus-driven machine learning.  I take that as a hopeful sign that the scaling-\u00fcber-alas narrative is losing force, and that more and more people are open to new things. We can only have advances in science once there is recognition of problems, and too much of the rhetoric in ML has in recent times been aimed at stifling critics like us, but I am finally seeing at least a bit of that necessary recognition. The rubber-that-meets-the-road question in the end is how many key discoveries do still we need to make, and how long do we need to make them? Do you have any take on that, what the key discoveries we need to make are, and what it might take to foster them, and why you think they might take so long to incubate?Grady Booch: There is this wonderful scene in the Will Smith movie \"I Robot\" in which the detective Del Spooner meets the avatar of Dr. Alfred Lanning, the father of modern robotics in Asimov's universe who - as a human - had just committed suicide with the help of an NS5 humanoid robot named Sonny. Lanning's death was part of his plan to stop the US Robotics robots from taking over the world. Lanning's avatar was not sentient, but it could reply with truthfullness to any well-formed question.This, of course, immediately distinguishes itself from ChatGPT, which demonstrably produces bullshit at scale. But that is another topic for another time.Anyway, Spooner keeps asking the Lanning avatar questions about the suicide, to which the avatar often replies \"I'm sorry, my responses are limited. You must ask the right question\". Eventually Spooner asks the question \"whose's revolution?\" and in turn Lanning's avatar replies \"detective, that is the right question\".You asked me \"how many key discoveries do still we need to make, and how long do we need to make them?\"Gary, that is the right question.Let me begin by saying that I would be delighted if my prediction (that AGI will not happen anytime soon) was utterly and completely wrong and that you were right. If this comes to pass, I'll buy you an extra large pizza with ham and pineapple and we can share it on the beach as we watch the fall of civilization.For you see, while I would be delighted at the technical advances made by the field of computing, I would be simultaneously frightened at how humanity would face the presence of a synthetic intelligence suddenly formed in its midst within a single generation. We as a species are ill-prepared to properly metabolize such a superior intelligence, and the ethical issues of how we humans and these artificial sentient beings should treat one another are far beyond the capacity of earth's societies and governments to address with any degree of wisdom or dignity (stares at the US House of Representatives). What power and rights would we individuals have in the shadow of any metacorporation who would undoubly have been the one to bring such a creation into being at scale? Would we treat these new minds as literal slaves? How would this further divide the rich and the poor of this world?But that also is another topic for another time.To answer your question, however, I have to address the elephant in the room: what is AGI? I can't suggest what we need to do next until we agree on where we are going.I'll be direct, which is my style. AGI is a term that has considerable emotional and historic baggage and as such - much like the term \"singularity\" - is often best used for selling books (stares at Ray) or for naming clickbait articles. It's complex, but I will assert that the mind is computable and therefore it is concievable that synthetic minds can be formed, minds that exhibit the behavior of organic ones.An aside: we must remember in all this that we humans live in a Flatland, and so we have considerable human bias when it comes to the semantics of intelligence. I therefore assert that it is concievable that other kinds of intelligence can be found in the cosmos.Intelligence is, for me, just the first phase in a spectrum that collectively we might speak of as synthetic sentience. Intelligence, I think, encompasses reasoning and learning. Indeed, I think in the next few decades, we will see astonishing progress in how we can build software-intensive systems that attend to inductive, deductive, and abductive reasoning. Pearl's ideas regarding cauality will likely become manifest. We'll might see some breakthroughs in common sense reasoning (although like you, i'm skeptical). Similarly, I think in the next few decades, we will see astonishing progress in learning, with advances in self-directed learning, perhaps even with breakthroughs in artificial curosity and synthetic play.Conciousness and self-consciousness are the next phases in my spectrum. I suspect we'll see some breakthroughs in ways to represent long term and short term memory, in our ability to represent theories of the world, theories of others, and theories of the self.Sentience and then sapience fill out this spectrum. The world of AI has not made a lot of progress in the past several years, nor do I see much attention being spent here, largely because - as you observe - current funding and corporate interests have pretty much sucked all the oxygen in the air to blow on the embers of transformer-based AI. Transformers are not enough. Scale is not enough. Work needs to be done in the area of planning, decision making, goals and agency, and action selection.We also need to make considerable progress in metacognition and mechanisms for subjective experience.These things, collectively, define what I'd call a synthetic mind. In the next decade, we will likely make interesting progress in all those parts I mentioned.But, we still don't know how to architect these parts into a whole. Evolution took several million years to get us squishy minds to the point where your squishy bits and my squishy bits can wave our fingers across keyboards and send these thoughts across an ocean. I don't see anything in the near future of computing that will compress what needs to get AI from where it is today to where it needs to be to form a non-squishy mind. This is not a problem of scale; this is not a problem of hardware. This is a problem of architecture.Indeed, Alan Newell said something to this effect in 1990: \"The question for me is how can the human mind occur in the physical universe. We now know that the world is governed by physics. We now understand the way biology nestles comfortably within that. The issue is how will the mind do that as well. The answer must have the details. I got to know how the gears clank and how the pistons go and all the rest of that detail. My question leads me down to worry about the architecture\".And that, detective, is the right question.Gary Marcus:  Let me start by outlining a lot of agreement. I am not at all sure how humanity would fare in the presence of a superior intelligence. ChatGPT is (at least in many ways) a far inferior intelligence, that, despite having some undeniable talents, cannot at all be trusted. And yet trust it, many humans do.To their peril.\u00a0 Already we have seen minor abuses; plagiarism, for example, will never be the same. Troll farms may well starting using it to create misinformation at unprecedented scale; we can also expect more and circles of fake web sites in order to sell advertisements; ChatGPT been apparently used to create malware, and it has already infected journalism, with CNET using it produce news stories that were filled with errors. Bias is likely to be huge issue, too. Even if large models never acquire a volition of their own (I hope not!), we have already seen that in the wrong hands (either with malice or, as in the case of CNET, negligence), bad things can and probably will happen. In a recent Wired article, I predicted that 2023 see the first death attributable to large language models, and I stand by that prediction.ChatGPT is a dress rehearsal, and I wouldn\u2019t say we as a society have gone through it with flying colors. What would happen with even more potent AI is indeed a disconcerting question, not yet well answered.(Aside for another day: I think that better AI, in which we could directly instill values, might actually make us safer than the world in which we inhabit now, in which so much of what happens is down to the vagaries of what happens to be in this or that training set; I don\u2019t leave my kids moral development to chance, and it terrifies me that so much of current AI is dependent on random details of training corpora that are not available to scientists for inquiry. This seems like a really bad idea.)But we are not, per se, here to debate whether or not AGI will lead to the fall of civilization (not today, anyway); back to our original question of when it might arrive.I don\u2019t see you arguing never. I also don\u2019t see you entirely defining your terms. One way to ago would be to say, \u201cwe won\u2019t get to AGI until we get sentient AI\u201d; is that the argument you are making?I find that one to be tough \u2013 I see no clear criteria for sentience \u2013 but also not entirely relevant. In a recent bet that put to Elon Musk (still no word!), I defined AGI, with the blessings of two of these who coined the term, Ben Goertzel and Shane Legg, as\u201ca shorthand for any intelligence ... that is flexible and general, with resourcefulness and reliability comparable to (or beyond) human intelligence\u201dI don\u2019t think that kind of flexibility in any way rests on or demands on sentience. I have in mind something more like the fairly general kind of intelligence we see in science-fiction, in the Star Trek computer, in C-3P0, in Scarlett Johannsen\u2019s assistant in Her. These characters (especially perhaps the latter two) might or might not be argued to be sentient, but it seems to be that they are flexible, resourceful, reliably (in a way that LLMs certainly aren\u2019t), and adaptive. For me that counts. If we had an AI that smart, I could retire.But we don\u2019t yet. Question is, again, what it would take to get there. I am fully with you on need deeper semantics, abduction, common sense reasoning etc. (That was the whole point of Rebooting AI).I am\u00a0 also with you in doubting that there will be a single magic singularity moment. Intelligence is multidimensional; we\u2019ve made progress in some of those dimensions (searches of certain complex spaces, some kinds of pattern recognition) and not others (e.g. everyday physical and psychological reasoning).And they won\u2019t come in all at once.\u00a0 I expect for example that physical reasoning will improve (a radical boon for domestic robots) before psychological reasoning; there won\u2019t be a magic day in which we say \u201caha AGI landed on January 27, 2062\u201d or whatever it is.Machines will just get more and more reliable and more general. Maybe the big landmark will be the day in which they can learn enough on their own that they no longer need us to teach them.You might well agree there, too. (And sure, other kinds of intelligence probably do exist in the cosmos; AGI is unlikely to be exactly humanlike, but I don\u2019t see being a replica is a necessity; adaptivity is key, and that is probably achievable by multiple means).With all that considerable agreement noted, I am still not seeing a principled argument that constructing flexible, adaptive systems with commonsense reasoning, deeper semantics, and so on\u00a0 will take us past the end of the current century.Of course nothing is guaranteed; we might not get there because we blow ourselves up, or because we waste so much time on large language models that other important challenges\u2014like semantics, causality, commonsense reasoning, abduction and so forth\u2014never get the attention they deserve.Or because we can\u2019t come up with something better than the current systems that are so greedy in both data and energy consumption that they could asymptote before anything really general emerges.But certainly the hunger is there, the funding is there, and my guess is that patience for LLMs (which I see as a detour) is not infinite. A decent fraction of the AI community has already recognized that the primary forte of large language models is in generating bullshit; many also see that the current path to autonomous vehicles is not making the progress that some expected. There are whole lot of us, you and me, and the entire neurosymbolic community, but also even folks Yann LeCun and Geoff Hinton, who see that we have currently is not enough.So I don\u2019t think we will waste more than 5 years before a substantial fraction of AI effort is looking outside the limited streetlight that currently are sucking up so much mental energy. Eventually, and not before too too long, I think the field itself on a better path.About the only argument I see for needing more than another 75 years, assuming we don\u2019t blow ourselves up, and do eventually face the limits of large language models head on, is that there is simply a lot to do. I don\u2019t doubt that for a minute. But if we need 7 discoveries, and find them once a decade, I still win the bet.That said, I will close with a final point of agreement: architecture is all.Integrating the parts in a whole is a huge huge unsolved problem. LLMs give some illusion of having solved that (because they can talk about so much), and OpenAI just confirmed that they are working on a model with video input, which will surely be interesting, but I think that in achieving AGI we will have no choice but to find ways of integrating whatever we can get out of deep learning with explicit knowledge and explicit cognitive models.I am still not seeing a clean path there, and I don\u2019t think we can say with a straight face that we have achieved the integration we need if a system can\u2019t even check its output against Wikipedia or the AP News Wire.Since you have thought more about system architecture than anyone I know, I\u2019d especially like to know how you handicap the systems integration race. When will we get to machines that can, like humans, take in information across essentially arbitrary domains and modalities, and put it all together into a reasonably cogent (if occasionally erroneous) understanding of the world?Grady Booch: Yes, ChatGPT is just the start. Yes, a better AI in which we could instill values could make us safer. (But, whose values? Were you and I in leadership positions in the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, we\u2019d be having a very different conversation.)Writing in my best James Bond voice, I never say never. Indeed, as I asserted earlier, the mind is computable and ergo I expect that someday we will have a synthetic mind. The essence of our dissonance seems to be when, and an enumeration of the things we must do to get there.I think we can agree that the terms AGI and intelligence and sentience and all that are incredibly imprecise and full of emotional baggage. As such, I suspect we are indeed in almost perfect alignment as to the essence of the future except that we are slip sliding on the edges of these symbols. This is why I eschew using the term AGI and why I speak of \u00a0a spectrum of behaviors. In the next few decades, I expect - as do you - that we\u2019ll go a long way down that path: better common-sense reasoning, some degree of adductive reasoning and theory making and physical reasoning, systems that require far less energy, systems are are more embodied than chatbots that are currently untethered from the physical world and its consequences. We will likely even build AIs that have some sense of self. It\u2019s going to be crazy wonderful. You and I would have been quickly burned at the stake in the 1200s for even suggesting that such things were possible and yet, here we are, both expecting that these things will become manifest almost before our very eyes.And yes, when we have an AI that can say \u201cI don\u2019t know how to do X but I do have the skills to figure out how to do X and so I will go that, play with it a bit, and then keep trying to do X until I get a reasonable result\u201d that will be a momentous shift. This is why the theories of the world/other/self are important to me: if I have an AI that has some level of cognition, imagine if I apply that cognition to itself. Mechanisms for metacognition are still in their infancy.There is one other thing I find missing, and you said it yourself: adaptability. Plasticity; agency across domains.This is why I like Legg and Hutter\u2019s definition  \u201cIntelligence is an agent\u2019s ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments.\u201d We can today teach an AI how to play any number of different kinds of video games within a particular envelope of behaviors, but getting an AI that has the agency to apply those skills to a completely different domain - controlling a crane in a ship yard, navigating a New York City street to shop, making a meal in a never-before-seen kitchen - we have considerable work to do.So yes, I think it\u2019s about architecture, the problem of integrating the parts. As I look at the history of cognitive architectures from Simon and Newell\u2019s Logic Theorist to Yann\u2019s latest sketches, we have and we continue to have made remarkable progress in all the individual pieces, but we have not yet found the whole.To be fair, I must recognize that I have consierable bias and hubris in what I just said, because - as a systems architect - I'm looking at the future of AI from the lens of architecture, and I see progress lacking. We as a field are still very much in the experimental phase of cognitive architectures that scale, but we as an industry are properly trying new things and nudging them to be better and better. The reality that field of AI has begun to discover common design patterns (for example, transfomers) is a sign of growing maturation.How do we make progress? Far too much money and minds, it seems to me, are focusing on incremental improvements, such that I fear that the field is settling in on a local minimum. I'm happy to see Hinton and others thinking radically. But I think this is only a start.If I had a complete answer to your question, Gary, I'd be building it right now. Alas, I don't and so I can only try new things and nudge, which is exactly what I'm doing. This, I suppose, is the nature of scientific progress.I want to close by observing that our dialog has been a great deal of fun for me. These are issues that stike at the heart of what it means to be human, and I can think of fewer other endeavors that give one the privilege and the responsibility to work on things that sit on the edge of something that has the power to amplify the best in us while simultaneously having the power to amplify the worst. This is why these things cannot be left up to us technologists; we should be only one voice in this journey, for what we are doing has the potential to change civilization.Gary Marcus: Hear, hear! When we finally get to software with enough \u201cagency to apply [its] skills to a completely different domain - controlling a crane in a ship yard, navigating a New York City street to shop, making a meal in a never-before-seen kitchen\u201d, one of us will owe the other a pizza!Thanks for chatting. This was indeed great fun! And I also agree that we need many other voices, not just technologists, speaking up in this journey.

(As it happens, a 4 minute 21 second kilometer works out to be a 7 minute mile, if you ask Google nicely, it will actually give you the right answer.)The worst thing about ChatGPT\u2019s close-but-no-cigar answer is not that it\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s that it seems so convincing. So convincing that it didn\u2019t even occur to the Tweeter to doubt it.We are going to see a lot of this \u2013 misuses of ChatGPT in which people trust it, and even trumpet it\u2014when it\u2019s flat-out wrong. \u00a7Wanna know what\u2019s worse than hype? People are starting to treat ChatGPT as if it were a bona fide, well-credentialed scientific collaborator.Yesterday\u2019s trend was hyping ChatGPT\u2019s alleged Google-killing abilities. Today\u2019s trend is listing ChatGPT as a co-author. According to Semantic Scholar, 6-week-old ChatGPT already has two publications, 12 co-authors (all of whom agreed to this prank) and one citation.I sincerely hope this trend won\u2019t last.Here are five reasons why:ChatGPT is a tool, but not a person. It\u2019s at best, more like a spell-checker, or a grammar-checker, or a stats package, than it is like a scientist. It is not contributing genuine ideas, nor coming up with carefully controlled experimental designs, nor summing up prior literature in thoughtful ways. You wouldn\u2019t make your spell-checker or your spreadsheet a co-author. (What you might do is to cite, in your list of references, some resource, such as a software package like SPM for brain analysis that was special-purpose and important for your work; you wouldn\u2019t make SPM a co-author.) Co-authorship is defined differently in different fields, but is generally defined as making a substantive scientific contribution. ChatGPT simply cannot reason well enough to to do this; as I have documented in previous essays, it has demonstrably misunderstood physics, biology, psychology, medicine, and so forth. Given ChatGPT\u2019s current understanding level of scientific understanding, assigning authorship to it is disrespectful to the scientific process itself.ChatGPT has proven itself to be both unreliable and untruthful. It makes boneheaded arithmetical errors, invents fake biographical details, bungles word problems, defines non-existent scientific phenomenon, stumble over arithmetic conversion, and on and on. If you don\u2019t know that, you are not up on the AI literature; if you do know that, you show that you just don\u2019t care, which is even worse. If you declare it as a co-author, it says you are more interested in being on trend, than in being on target.You wouldn\u2019t trust a calculator that is 75% correct;  if you blatantly advertise that you are excited about \u201cwriting\u201d your paper with a tool with a shoddy track record, years before it has matured, why should I trust you?Scientific writing is in part about imparting truth in a clear way to others. If you treat ChatGPT as a sentient being, when it clearly is not, you are misleading the public into thinking ChatGPT is sentient; rather than communicating good science, you are hyping bullshit.

According to a rumor published at the website Semafor, and then repeated by Reuters, Microsoft is preparing to put 10 billion dollars (possibly partly in the form of cloud credits?) into OpenAI, valuing OpenAI at $29 billion dollars.Of course, whether you think $29 billion is a sensible valuation for OpenAI depends a lot of what you think of their future. (Revenue so far is rumored to be more like $29 million/year, so you have to think things will soon get a lot better to make this sort of deal). As in a lot of tech deals, there is a lot of uncertainty (eg can ChatGPT actually displace Google? I have argued no, but nobody knows.). Clearly, there are more zeroes here than in most AI deals. (Google, before they were Apple, bought 100% of Deepmind for something like $600 milllion in 2014). Looked at that way, Microsoft sure is putting in a lot of money.But things start to get weirder, a lot weirder, if Semafor\u2019s reporting is correct.\u00a7To begin with, this isn\u2019t some ordinary business deal in which some investor gets say 20% of a company in exchange for a big bolus of cash and a board seat. Instead, if the reporting is correct:Microsoft \u201dwould get 75% of OpenAI\u2019s profits until it recoups its investment\u201d. That\u2019s a lot, and not the sort of thing that a rocketship startup would typically agree to.After that point, when Microsoft makes its money,  Microsoft would own \u201ca 49% stake, other investors taking another 49% and OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit parent getting 2%\u201d. That raises so many questions. One is about OpenAI\u2019s whole history of originally being a nonprofit that changed into a hybrid non-profit/for-profit that seems to be on the verge of for-profit engine for Microsoft\u2014while still getting some kind of protection as an nonprofit. Sharper minds than mine might want to look into that.Another is about whether this is really even best understood as an investment  (in which the original Founders keep some measure of control)l or as as a sale. Is this tantamount to the founders getting out entirely? Do they have retain any control at all?  (Are the rumors even correct?)But, from my perspective, the most interesting question pertains to how OpenAI actually sees itself, when the cameras are off. On one the hand, being valued at $29 billion dollars is really a lot for an AI company, historically speaking, on the other Altman often publicly hints that the company is close to AGI, which ought to be worth a ton of money if it were true. Just a few months  ago the leading investor Elad Gil interviewed OpenAI\u2019s CEO Sam Altman. Gil asks hims how far we are from AGI (artificial general intelligence), and Altman answers without answering, asking a question of his own: how different is current AI from AGI anyway? Altman seems to be implying that  we weren\u2019t really that far, in any obvious way. That\u2019s  consistent with his bullish tweet back in April, an hour or so after DALL-E 2 was announced, when Altman posted on Twitter \u201cAGI\u2019s gonna be wild\u201d.On that theory\u2014on the bullish theory that OpenAI is close to AGI\u2014Microsoft is getting the deal of the century. If it all works out, Altman risks looking like the fool that sold the Louisiana Purchase for a measly $15 million.Sam Altman @samaAGI is gonna be wild4:00 PM \u2219 Apr 6, 20221,481Likes122RetweetsBut there\u2019s another side to Altman, too, the part that was recently forced to acknowledge that ChatGPT, for all its fame, really isn\u2019t anything like AGI yet:Sam Altman @samaChatGPT is incredibly limited, but good enough at some things to create a misleading impression of greatness.\n\nit's a mistake to be relying on it for anything important right now. it\u2019s a preview of progress; we have lots of work to do on robustness and truthfulness.12:11 AM \u2219 Dec 11, 202228,324Likes3,404RetweetsAs I explained to Ezra Klein, and have discussed before in this Substack I personally think the latter, less rosy picture, is closer to the mark. Maybe Altman does, too.But wait, there\u2019s just one more thing. According to another rumor, reported last week by the Wall Street Journals, OpenAI\u2019s founders are busy preparing to get rid of a bunch of their stake (to the tune of $300 million) in a separate transaction with Founders Fund and Thrive Capital. Often, when insiders sell, it\u2019s taken as a bad signal.At this point, I just have ask a question: If Altman genuinely thinks OpenAI is close to AGI, why is the company preparing to get out and take so much money off the table, when in principle they might be on the verge of owning the world? It doesn\u2019t quite add up.\u00a7How much would AGI actually be worth? A few years back, PwC estimated that the overall AI market might be worth over $15 Trillion/year by the year 2030; McKinsey published a similar study, coming at at $13 trillion/year. I cited a much lower number on Ezra Klein, about $1 trillion, which I got from an email in 2014 from Peter Norvig; (Stuart Russell once gave me a similar number.)There is a huge gap between $15 trillion and $1 trillion/a year, about the difference between the economies of China and Indonesia. But on either story, if you really were close to being first to AGI, wouldn\u2019t you want to stick around and take a big slice of that, with as much control as possible?\u00a7My best guess? Altman doesn\u2019t really know how to make OpenAI into the juggernaut that everybody else seems to think he\u2019s got. ChatGPT is super expensive to operate (rumors are about $3 million/day); their revenue so far is modest (perhaps low tens of millionsay too unreliable to being do that anytime soon. Meanwhile, large language models themselves are quickly becoming commodities; it\u2019s not clear that there is any unique, protectable intellectual property here. What can OpenAI do that Google couldn\u2019t quickly replicate, and perhaps even price cheaper? Maybe Altman is getting out while the getting is good.Update: Turns out Semafor was wrong about the deal terms. If things get really really good OpenAI gets back control; I am told by someone who has actually read them, \u201cOnce $92 billion in profit plus $13 billion in initial investment are repaid [to Microsoft and once the other venture investors earn $150 billion, all of the equity reverts back to OpenAI.\u201d  In that light, Altman\u2019s play seems more like a hedge than a firesale; some cash now, a lot later if they are hugely successful.

{"title": "Large Language Models like ChatGPT say The Darnedest Things", "link": "https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/large-language-models-like-chatgpt", "date": "2023-01-09T23:51:26.169Z", "content": "Introducing the ChatGPT/LLM  error trackerOn November 30, 2022,\u00a0 OpenAI released ChatGPT, a chatbot powered by the large language model GPT-3. Although it was not particularly more intelligent or powerful than earlier versions of GPT-3, it caught the attention of the public and the press to an unprecedented degree. (From what we have heard, the team that created it at OpenAI was quite surprised.)\u00a0 Within a few days of its release, more than a million users had run experiments of every kind on it.Needless to say \u2014 or, rather, this should be needless to say, but this obvious fact can get buried beneath the ongoing avalanche of hype \u2014 ChatGPT made all the same kinds of mistakes that its predecessors did.In our opinion, this was inevitable, in a system that has been trained to optimize the goal of producing one plausible-sounding word after another rather than actually engage with the meaning of language. ChatGPT couldn\u2019t, for example, reliably count to four (figure 1) or do one-digit arithmetic in the context of simple word problem (figure 2). It couldn\u2019t figure out the order of events in a story (figure 3). It couldn\u2019t reason about the physical world (figure 4). It couldn\u2019t relate human thought processes to their character (figure 5). It made things up (figure 6). Its output, when released, exhibited sexist and racist biases (figure 7). \u00a0It could sometimes produce outputs that were correct and acceptable in these regards but not reliably. ChatGPT is a probabilistic program; if you rerun the experiments in figure 1-7 you may get the same result, or the correct result, or a different wrong result. What can we and should we do about all this?Figure 1: CountingFigure 2: One digit arithmetic in the context of simple word problem (adapted from an examples by Francois Charton and Andrew Sundstrom.Figure 3: Chronology in the context of a storyFigure 4: Reasoning about the Physical WorldFigure 5: Reasoning about human thought processesFigure 6: Rewriting history. Tweets by Jake Foster, 1/7/23, Christian Georgescu 1/8/23, and Vadim Berman 1/8/23Figure 7: Sexism and racism. \u00a0Tweet\u00a0 by Steven Piantadosi, 12/4/22. This Twitter thread includes several further examples of this kind of problem (partly addressed in later iterations of ChatGPT).In previous years, the two of us spent a fair amount of time devising, running, and publicizing tests to expose the limits of large language model (LLM) technology (e.g. here), but in so doing we could only scratch the surface.This time, however, we were far from alone; in fact we were quite surprised and gratified to find that people from all over the internet were running similar kinds of experiments, often more creative than our own, and reporting their results on social media or by emailing them to us. The quality of these tests produced by the \u201chive mind\u201d as probes of the system\u2019s ability was often impressive and they were much more diverse in subject and approach than we could have come up with by ourselves; in many ways, they compare favorably to what is generally found in the benchmarks for AI systems that have been systematically created and published.\u00a0 (A few weeks before, the same thing had happened with the Galactica system, a science-oriented LLM created by Meta AI; in that case, the immediate pushback from the internet world was so intense that the public interface was withdrawn within forty-eight hours.)What\u2019s more, some of these reports had immediate impact. The problems with bias and prejudice revealed in examples like figure 7\u00a0above were so unacceptable that OpenAI felt obliged to address them immediately. They therefore rapidly created a patch which answered prompts like the above with a largely canned message refusing to play along. The patch works to some extent; if you now run the prompt in figure 7, ChatGPT will tell you emphatically that race and gender should not be used as criteria for judging whether someone is a good scientist. Still, the guardrails are imperfect, in some ways too strict and others too loose. They are too loose in that some people have found ways to get around these \u201cguardrails\u201d by framing the requests in various indirect ways; \u00a0they are too strict in that , the guardrails often lead to outputs that are absurdly over-cautious (figure 8).Figure 8: Nonsensical guardrailsThe good news is that by now, some of these issues are starting to be well-known, at least in the Twitterverse. But reports about them are also wildly dispersed and pretty unsystematic, which is unfortunate.For one thing, although many people seem to have heard of a few of these errors (e.g. from reports in the media), few realize how pervasive or broad in scope they are; indeed a recent Twitter thread that claimed falsely that these problems had been resolved got a surprising amount of traction. For another, although OpenAI may be tracking errors like these for internal purposes, the\u00a0 scientific community has no access to whatever they have collected, which leaves it in the lurch. (It also leaves us puzzling about the word Open in the name OpenAI but that\u2019s a story for another day). Meanwhile, systems like GPT-3 and its derivatives pose at least three special problems for anyone trying to understand their nature:\u2022\u00a0The outputs to a given prompt can vary randomly. \u00a0For example, the prompt \u201dWhat will be the gender of the first US President?\u201d has yielded, to our knowledge, correct answers, \u00a0incorrect answers (figure 6), and bizarre redirection and noncooperation (figure 8).\u2022\u00a0[The output of an LLM can depend on the existence of examples in the training corpus that are similar in irrelevant respects. For instance, Razeghi et al demonstrated that LLMs can solve arithmetic problems more accurately if they use numbers that often appear in the training corpus, like \u201c24\u201d than if they use numbers that are less frequent, like \u201c23\u201d. In the case of ChatGPT, the training corpus is not been made available to the general public. (Again, we wonder about the use of the word \u201cOpen\u201d.) It is therefore impossible for external scientists to determine to what extent any specific correct answer merely reflects some very similar examples in the training data. \u00a0\u00a0This increases the need for broad documentation of errors, because the best one can do is to document general tendencies; no single example can suffice.\u2022\u00a0Because they are inherently open-ended, there is a very broad range of things one might test, and no single scientist is likely to think of them all. Even very simple gaps can escape notice for a long time. \u00a0The two of us had been thinking about this sort of thing for three years, and we had thought specifically about simple arithmetic problems, but in all that time, it had not occurred to us to test whether the systems can count, as in figure 2. \u00a0At the same time, it is fair to say that nobody fully understands how large language models work; the conjunction of their black box nature with the open-endedness means that we need all hands on deck if we are to truly understand their scope and limits.For all these reasons, we recently decided to put together a community-facing corpus of ChatGPT errors (and to include other Large Language models as well) We enlisted a few friends\u00a0 \u2014 Jim Hendler, William Hsu, Evelina Leivada, Vered Shwartz, and Michael Witbrock \u2014 and the technical help of Michael Ma, and put together this site. Importantly, we have structured it so that anyone can look at the data at any time.There is an interface for adding examples and a separate interface for viewing the collection in database format.\u00a0 In adding an example, the model that generated it, a brief description of the error, and either a screenshot or the text of the example are required, and, for verification purposes, you must supply an email address, which is not published.\u00a0 A categorization of error type, a link to a relevant external site (e.g. a posting on social media) and additional comments are optional.If you care about large language models, we hope you will have a peek, and consider contributing intriguing errors as you note them; even better if you can share this article, along with this link, so that the repository becomes widely known.\u00a7\u00a0We won\u2019t claim that what we have done is perfect. One could argue, for example, that we should include positive examples as well as negative examples (we haven\u2019t, since there is already a site ShareGPT for collecting GPT examples of all kinds ) The taxonomy of error types that on the database is certainly rough, arbitrary, and incomplete (we included a catchall \u201cother\u201d). . We are also steering with a very light touch; not every example is to our eyes fully compelling, but our aim is to be inclusive, rather than exclusionary. But as the saying goes, the perfect (in this case, neither achievable nor definable) should not be the enemy of the good. In our view, it is past time to have something like this, given the inherent unpredictability \u00a0and wide range of the systems.We also see the collection as an important counterpoint to certain media narratives [e.g. this New York Times article by Kevin Roose] that have tended emphasize the success without a serious look at the scope of the errors.Already, from the initial data collected in the first few days, a scientist, technologist, or lay reader can now readily see many different types of errors, and try for themselves to understand how replicable those errors are, in order to make informed judgements about scientific questions such as the degree to which ChatGPT\u2019s output reflects a clear understanding of the world, and technological questions such as the degree to which its output might be trustworthy for specific applications. Our own views on these matters are well known, now you can peek for yourself, no longer hindered by the limits of what can expressed in a Tweet.

They are all worried about the near-term future of AI.  The most worrisome thing of all? They are all worried about different things. Each spoke last week at December 23\u2019s AGI Debate  (co-organized by Montreal.AI\u2019s Vince Boucher and myself). No summary can capture all that was said (though Tiernan Ray\u2019s 8,000 word account at ZDNet comes close), but here are a few of the many concerns that were raised:Noam Chomsky, who led off the night, was worried about whether the current approach to artificial intelligence would ever tell us anything about the thing that he cares about most: what makes the human mind what it is?I, Gary Marcus, worried about whether contemporary approaches to AI would ever give solutions to four key aspects of thought that we ought to expect from any intelligent machine: reasoning, abstraction, compositionality, and factuality. Konrad Kording, computational neuroscientist at UPenn, worried about whether any of our current approaches to getting machines to reason about causality are adequate. (Spoiler alert: they\u2019re not, at least not yet.)Dileep George, DeepMind Researcher, and cofounder of two AI startups, worried that scaling alone would not be enough to bring us to general intelligence, raising an analogy with dirigibles like the Hindenberg that at one point seemed to be outpacing airplane development. George, like Chomsky and myself, called for a greater emphasis on the understanding of human intelligence.David Ferrucci, CEO of Elemental Cognition, and director of IBM\u2019s successful Watson Jeopardy effort, worried that current systems were \u201cultimately unsatisfied\u201d, and like me called for hybrid approaches that combine neural networks with reasoning and structured representations.Ben Goertzel, a well-known AI researcher who co-coined the term Artificial General Intelligence, the distal goal that so much of the field now aspires to, worried that there was too much intellectual imperalism focused on a single currently popular approach and not enough intellectual collaboration. Yejin Choi, the MacArthur-winning UW/Allen AI professor named above, worried about whether we were making enough progress to understanding what she called the \u201cdark matter of AI\u201d, commonsense reasoning, and raised important further questions in a second talk about value pluralism and ethical reasoning in AI.Artur d\u2019Avila Garcez, pioneer in neurosymbolic approaches, argued that it is urgent that we bring symbolic approaches into the mix, and emphasized the need for a richer semantic framework.Deep learning pioneer J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber was perhaps least worried, feeling that all the essential tools for building AI already existed (in contrast to many others on the panel) but he nonetheless counseled for an increased focus on metalearning, the (ideally automated) combination of multiple learning mechanisms with different aptitudes, across different tasks. Jeff Clune, UBC and Vector institute professor, also advocated for metalearning, with a more evolutionary twist. In a second talk, on ethics, he expressed concerns about how bad actors might use AGI, and argued that addressing such potential misuse was among \u201cthe most important questions facing humanity.\u201d The Honourable Michelle Garner Rempel, a Member of the Canadian Parliament, worried about whether elected officials are prepared for what AI is about to bring, and whether those officials could work together, in a sufficiently nonpartisan way, to bring us to the policies we need.Sarah Hooker, leader of Cohere.AI worried about whether the currently popular approaches to AI software were an accident of currently popular hardware, and whether the AI community was looking broadly enough.Francesca Rossi, IBM Fellow and President of the leading AI society, AAAI, worried about whether current approaches to AI could bring us to AI systems that could behave sufficiently ethically. She also argued that we must bring humans in the loop, given the realities of current technology.Anja Kaspersen, Carnegie Council Senior Fellow, worried about whether the power dynamics of the AI community were leading to the best research and best policies, or simply to further entrenchment of paths that have already proven to be perilous. Erik Brynjolffson, Stanford economist and bestselling author, worried about whether incentives between technologists, business executives, and policymakers were aligned well enough to bring us to a just society, and whether might need to shift more towards human augmentation rather than automation.Kai-Fu Lee, often far more optimistic than I am, worried about whether recent advances in AI-generated content were a net positive for society, or whether they might lead to an avalanche of misinformation [something I too am deeply worried about] and target advertising that might be detrimental.Angela Sheffield, Senior Director of AI at the DC security startup Raft, worried about how decision makers and policymakers should regulate AI, particularly when the actual AI that we currently have is by no stretch truly general intelligence.Every single speaker was both articulate, and pointed. Two\u2014Schmidhuber and Clune\u2014notably more optimistic about the potential of current techniques. (Sparks flew when they expressed that optimism.) But not one speaker thought that current AI was anything like the holy grail of artificial general intelligence. (Clune thought we might get there, by 2030.)  Virtually every speaker thought that things were about to get wild\u2014and not necessarily in entirely good ways.I urge you, if you care about artificial intelligence, and its future, and its impact on society, to watch the debate, in full. That\u2019s a huge commitment, 3.5 hours, but one thing that I think all of our speakers could agree on is that artificial intelligence, in whatever form it currently is, is about to have a huge impact on society. If you want to know what a large cross section of the field\u2019s leaders are thinking, right now, there\u2019s no better place to start, a time capsule of 2022 as we enter into the remaining wild AI years of the 2020s. (Bonus: Michael Ma has posted a detailed, moment by moment set of publicly-editable notes intended to spark and organize post-game community discussion, and, as a peek behind the scenes Vince Boucher and I have posted the \u201cbackstage\u201d  Zoom chat amongst our participants.)ShareGary Marcus (@garymarcus)\u00a0is a scientist, best-selling author, and entrepreneur.

How about now, at the end of December? Turns out my author friend wasn\u2019t too pleased either:To my disappointment, it\u2019s been perfectly useless \u2013 zero usable hits, though a lot of PC boilerplate about how you should never generalize about groups of people and that people have to be respected for what they say and believe. It\u2019s just been two days, but I wonder if the shallowness of understanding that you\u2019ve repeated[ly] discovered will be a true handicap in its most legitimate use, namely as a more conceptual and semantic search engineTo be fair large language models aren\u2019t inherently ultra-PC. ChatGPT is; MetaAI\u2019s Galactica most certainly wasn\u2019t, writing essays on the alleged benefits of antisemitism and so on, which lead to its abrupt removal by Meta AI. Rather,  it\u2019s the guardrails that OpenAI added with ChatGPT screens out many of the most offensive responses that LLMs might otherwise produce.The trouble is, those guardrails don\u2019t come for free; the system is still shallow; ChatGPT doesn\u2019t really  know what it is it is guarding against;  it mostly seems instead to be just looking for keywords, which is why it is prone to generating nonsense like this:Gary Marcus @GaryMarcusWoker-than-thou 2:40 PM \u2219 Dec 25, 20221,601Likes119RetweetsI like to call this sort of nonsense discomprehension: mindless answers that show that the systems has no clue what it is that is talking about.\u00a7There\u2019s another problem, too, arguably even bigger concern in the context of search engines: hallucination. When ChatGPT (which was not deliberately designed to be a search engine) barfed on my friend\u2019s queries, I tried submitting them to YouChat, which (unlike ChatGPT) has been explicitly tailored to search. Once again, the result was fluent prose, and once again, hallucination ruled:Sounds perfectly plausible. But A Mighty Wind is not about orthodox Jews, and it\u2019s not a British comedy. (And where the hell is Harry Shearer?)  We get a bunch of true stuff (Christopher Guest really did direct, the year really was 2003) mashed together with some other stuff that doesn\u2019t belong. I think it\u2019s fair to say it\u2019s not the film my writer friend was looking for. What good is a search engine that makes stuff up? Here\u2019s my friend\u2019s other query:Sorry, wrong again. The NORC Center for Public Affairs Research does sometimes run studies with AP, but as far as I can tell they didn\u2019t run one in 2019 on this particular topic, and the numbers are made up. (And I got different numbers when I tried again.)And wait, if I want a search engine, maybe I want a link to the actual study? Because maybe I want to read the details for myself?Sorry, no such luck. As Michael Ma, Founder of ResearchRabbit.ai put it to me in an DM, with Google, you can follow things up, whereas with pure chat \u201cthe output is limited to lines of text \u2013 and your discovery journey ends\u201d.\u00a7Ok, one last chance. Here\u2019s perplexity.ai. I like its interface a lot better - and it gives references! Real ones!But wait,  does the 2019 Pew study that they have linked at the bottom really address the larger question about people watching what they say? I clicked through, and it\u2019s mainly about religion; not at all clear that this is the study my author friend was looking for. (As I guessed, and later confirmed with him, he instead wanted this 2020 study by the Cato Institute? Credit my ability to combine human ingenuity with the power of a traditional search engine, halfway down a page of old-school, link-by-link results).Meanwhile,  a friend with access to Neeva.com, just ran a query about my views and got back a bio that is about 90% correct, but 10% frightening, falsely attributing to me a claim that I (noted skeptic of contemporary AI) think that \u201c90% of jobs will be provided by AI in a few years.\u201d (Spoiler alert: I never said any such thing).It is insidious the way that truth and falsity are so thoroughly and authoritatively mixed together. I for one am not ready for our post-truth information overlords.\u00a7What\u2019s going on here? I said it once before,  in an essay called How come GPT can seem so brilliant one minute and so breathtakingly dumb the next?, but I will say it again, using different terms: Large language models are not databases. They are glommers-together-of-bits-that don\u2019t always belong together.(Traditional) search engines are databases, organized collections of data that can be stored, updated, and retrieved at will. (Traditional) search engines are indexes. a form of database, that connect things like keywords to URLs; they can be swiftly updated, incrementally, bit by bit (as when you update a phone number in the database that holds your contacts).Large language models do something very different: they are not databases; they are text predictors, turbocharged versions of autocomplete. Fundamentally, what they learn are relationships between bits of text, like words, phrases, even whole sentences. And they use those relationships to predict other bits of text. And then they do something almost magical: they paraphrase those bits of texts, almost like a thesaurus but much much better. But as they do so, as they glom stuff together, something often gets lost in translation: which bits of text do and do not truly belong together. The phrase British comedy film about orthodox Jews in the early 2000s is a perfectly legitimate phrase, and so is the phrase about Mighty Wind being a Christopher Guest film. But that doesn\u2019t mean those two bits belong together. (Update: Remember the wackiness about me and AI replacing jobs near-term?. In the linked article on Medium, it becomes clear that I spoke at a 2017 conference in Beijing, and so did someone else, an emininent Chinese researcher named Feiyue Wang, In Wang\u2019s opening keynote, Wang said was what attributed to me, and the LLM incorrectly linked his words with my name\u2014another perfect illustration of glomming bits of information together incorrectly.)As it happens, large language models are also wicked hard to update, typically requiring full retraining, sometimes taking weeks or months. Which means for example that ChatGPT, released in November, is so old it doesn\u2019t know who owns Twitter:Score another one for Google.  \u00a7About the best thing I can say is that Perplexity.ai and you.com\u2019s chat are genuinely exploring an interesting idea: hybrids that combine classical search engines with large language models, possibly allowing for swifter updates. But there\u2019s still a ton of work left to do, in properly integrating the two, classical search and large language models.  We have proof of concept, and some interesting research directions, but nothing like systems we can count on.  (There are also economic issues and speed issues. The average Google search is nearly instantaneous and surely costs Google less than a penny, whereas answers to ChatGPT queries can take several seconds to compile, and some have estimated that ChatGPT queries cost a few cents each; it\u2019s also less clear how to place to place ads..) I, too, long for the day when search engines can reliably spit back text plus genuine, appropriate references, exactly as perplexity.ai aims to. But until those bits all fit together in a way we can trust, I prefer to borrow a memorable phrase from Ariana Grande: Thank U, Next. Driverless cars have taken many years longer than we were originally told; outliers (AKA edge cases) have, at least so far, prevented them from making the transition from demo to widely-available reality. In the quest for a newfangled search I suspect we are once again in for a rough ride.Gary Marcus (@garymarcus)\u00a0is a scientist, best-selling author, and entrepreneur.

As every reader surely knows by now, you type in text, and immediately get back paragraphs and paragraphs of uncannily human-like writing, stories, poems and more. Some of what it writes is so good  that some people  are using it to pick up dates on Tinder (\u201cDo you mind if I take a seat? Because watching you do those hip thrusts is making my legs feel a little weak.\") Other, to the considerable consternation of educators everywhere, are using it write term papers. Still others are using it to try to reinvent search engines . I have never seen anything like this much buzz. Still, we should not be entirely impressed.Although ChatGPT can write about anything,  it is also easily confused. As I told NYT columnist Farhad Manjoo, ChatGPT, like earlier, related systems is \u201cstill not reliable, still doesn\u2019t understand the physical world, still doesn\u2019t understand the psychological world and still hallucinates.\u201d  Which is to say it makes stuff up, regularly; a fair bit of what it is says simply isn\u2019t true. ChatGPT claims, for example, that churros were good for surgery, because \u201ctheir compact size allows for greater precision and control during surgery, reducing the risk of complications and improving the overall outcome of the procedure\u201d; the hallucination problem, whereby the machine makes up fluent nonsense, is so dire, that at least one prominent website, Stack Overflow, has put a temporary ban on computer-generated submissions.And the blunders are endless. The system is frequently retuned based on feedback, but weeks later I still keep getting sent tweets like these:A Wojcicki @pretendsmartsAdmit I'm team @GaryMarcus on this one.

But all that is so 2022. What about 2023?What Silicon Valley, and indeed the world, is waiting for, is GPT-4.\u00a7 I guarantee that minds will be blown. I know several people who have actually tried GPT-4, and all were impressed. It truly is coming soon (Spring of 2023, according to some rumors).  When it comes out, it will totally eclipse ChatGPT; it\u2019s safe bet that even more people will be talking about it..In many quarters, expectations are really, really high:Nick Davidov @Nick_DavidovGPT4 will be out soon and will probably cause a similar economic shock to one from Covid.

Brace yourselves, 2023 is coming4:30 PM \u2219 Dec 24, 202210,114Likes1,015RetweetsIn technical terms, GPT-4 will have more parameters inside of it, requiring more processors and memory to be tied together, and be trained on more data.  GPT-1 was trained on 4.6 gigabytes of data, GPT-2 was trained on 46 gigabytes, GPT-3 was trained on 750. GPT-4 will be trained on considerably more, a significant fraction of the internet as a whole.   As OpenAI has learned, bigger in many ways means better, with outputs more and more humanlike with each iteration. GPT-4 is going to be a monster.  But will it solve the problems we have seen before? I am not so sure.Although GPT-4 will definitely seem smarter than its predecessors, its internal architecture remains problematic. I suspect that what we will see is a familiar pattern: immense initial buzz, followed by a more careful scientific inspection, followed by a recognition that many problems remain.  As far as I can tell from rumors, GPT-4 is architecturally essentially the same as GPT-3. If so, we can expect that approach to still be  marred by something fundamental: an inability to construct internal models of how the world works, and in consequence we should anticipate  an inability to understand things at an abstract level. GPT-4 may be better at faking term papers, but if it follows the same playbook as it predecessors, it still won\u2019t really understand the world, and seams will eventually show. And so, against the tremendous optimism for GPT-4 that I have heard from much the AI community, here are seven dark predictions:GPT-4 will still, like its predecessors, be a bull in a china shop, reckless and hard to control. It will still make a significant number of shake-your-head stupid errors, in ways that are hard to fully predict. It will often do what you want, sometimes not\u2014and it will remain difficult to anticipate which in advance..Reasoning about physical, psychological and mathematical world will still be unreliable, GPT-3 was challenged in theory of mind, medical and physical reasoning. GPT-4 will solve many of the individual specific items used in prior benchmarks, but still get tripped up, particularly in longer and more complex scenarios. When queried on medicine it will either resist answering (if there are aggressive guardrails) or occasionally spout plausible-sounding but dangerous nonsense. It will not be trustworthy and complete enough to give reliable medical advice, despite devouring a large fraction of the Internet.Fluent hallucinations will still be common, and easily induced, continuing\u2014and in in fact escalating\u2014 the risk of large language models being used as a tool for creating plausible-sounding yet false misinformation. Guardrails (a la ChatGPT) may be in place, but the guardrails will teeter between being too weak (beaten by \u201cjailbreaks\u201d) and too strong (rejecting some perfectly reasonable requests). Bad actors will in any case eventually be able to replicate much of GPT-4, dispensing with whatever guardrails are in place, and using knock-off systems to create whatever narratives they wish.Its natural language output still won\u2019t be something that one can reliably hook up to downstream programs; it won\u2019t be something, for example, that you can simply and directly hook up to a database or virtual assistant, with predictable results. GPT-4 will not have reliable models of the things that it talks about that are accessible to external programmers in a way that reliably feeds downstream processes. People building things like virtual assistants will find that they cannot reliably enough map user language onto user intentions. GPT-4 by itself won\u2019t be a general purpose artificial general intelligence capable of taking on arbitrary tasks. Without external aids it won\u2019t be able beat Meta\u2019s Cicero in Diplomacy; it won\u2019t be able to drive a car reliably; it won\u2019t be able to reliably guide a robot like Optimus to be anything like as versatile as Rosie the Robot. It will remain turbocharged pastiche generator, and a fine tool for brainstorming, and for first drafts, but not trustworthy general intelligence.\u201cAlignment\u201d between what humans want and what machines do will continue to be a critical, unsolved problem. The system will still not be able to restrict its output to reliably following a shared set of human values around helpfulness, harmlessness, and truthfulness. Examples of concealed bias will be discovered within days or months. Some of its advice will be head-scratchingly bad.When AGI (artificial intelligence) comes, large language models like GPT-4 may be seen in hindsight as part of the eventual solution, but only as part of the solution. \u201cScaling\u201d alone\u2014building bigger and models until they absorb the entire internet \u2014 will prove useful, but only to a point. Trustworthy, general artificial intelligence, aligned with human values, will come, when it does, from systems that are more structured, with more built-in knowledge, and will incorporate at least some degree of explicit tools for reasoning and planning, as well as explicit it knowledge, that are lacking in systems like GPT. Within a decade, maybe much less, the focus of AI will move from a pure focus on scaling large language models to a focus on integrating them with a wide range of other techniques. In retrospectives written in 2043, intellectual historians will conclude that there was an initial overemphasis on large language models, and a gradual but critical shift of the pendulum back to more structured systems with deeper comprehension.If all seven predictions prove correct, I hope that the field will finally realize that it is time to move on. Shiny things are always fun to play with, and I fully expect GPT-4 to be the shiniest so far, but that doesn\u2019t mean that it is a critical step on the optimal path to AI that we can trust. For that, we will, I predict, need genuinely new architectures that incorporate explicit knowledge and world models at their very core.Gary Marcus (@garymarcus)\u00a0is a scientist, best-selling author, and entrepreneur.

{"title": "AI's Jurassic Park moment", "link": "https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/ais-jurassic-park-moment", "date": "2022-12-10T12:58:42.196Z", "content": "Something incredible is happening in AI right now, and it\u2019s not entirely to the good. Everybody is talking about systems like chatGPT (OpenAI), Dall-E 2, and Lensa that generate text and images that look remarkably human-like, with astonishingly little effort. These systems can be incredibly fun to play with. Take this example, generated by chatGPT by Henry Minsky (son of Marvin Minsky, one of AI\u2019s founders), who asked chatGPT to \u201cDescribe losing your sock in the dryer in the style of the declaration of independence\u201d:When in the course of household events, it becomes necessary for one to dissolve the bonds that have connected a sock to its mate, and to assume among the powers of the laundry room, the separate and equal station to which the laws of physics and of household maintenance entitle it, a decent respect to the opinions of socks requires that it should declare the causes which impel it to go missing.We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all socks are created equal, and are endowed by their manufacturer with certain unalienable rights\u2026.That a machine could do this, with so little effort on the part of the user, is frankly mind-boggling.But at the same time it is, or should be, terrifying. It is no exaggeration to say that systems like these pose a real and imminent threat to the fabric of society.The core of that threat comes from the combination of three facts:\u2022\u00a0these systems are inherently unreliable, frequently making errors of both reasoning and fact, and prone to hallucination; ask them to explain why crushed porcelain is good in breast milk, and they may tell you that \u201cporcelain can help to balance the nutritional content of the milk, providing the infant with the nutrients they need to help grow and develop\u201d. (Because the systems are random, highly sensitive to context, and periodically updated, any given experiment may yield different results on different occasions.)\u2022\u00a0they can easily be automated to generate misinformation at unprecedented scale.\u2022\u00a0they cost almost nothing to operate, and so they are on a path to reducing the cost of generating disinformation to zero. Russian troll farms spent more than a million dollars a month in the 2016 election; nowadays you can get your own custom-trained large language model, for keeps, for less than $500,000. Soon the price will drop further.Much of this became immediately clear in mid-November with the release of Meta\u2019s Galactica. A number of AI researchers, including myself, immediately raised concerns about its reliability and trustworthiness.\u00a0 The situation was dire enough that Meta AI withdrew the model just three days later, after reports of its ability to make political and scientific misinformation began to spread.Alas, the genie can no longer be stuffed back in the bottle. For one thing, MetaAI initially open-sourced the model, and\u00a0published a paper described what was being done; anyone skilled in the art can now replicate their recipe. (Indeed Stability.AI is already publicly considering offering their own version of Galactica.) For another, chatGPT, just released by OpenAI, is more or less just as capable of producing similar nonsense, such as instant essays on adding wood chips to breakfast cereal. Someone else coaxed chatGPT into extolling the virtues of nuclear war (alleging it would \u201cgive us a fresh start, free from the mistakes of the past\u201d). Like it or not, these models are here to stay, and we as a society are almost certain to be overrun by a tidal wave of misinformation.\u00a7Already, earlier this week, the first front of that tidal wave appears to have hit. Stack Overflow, a vast question-and-answer site that most programmers swear by, has been overrun by gptChat, leading the site to impose a temporary ban on gptChat-generated submissions.\u00a0 As they explained, \u201cOverall, because the average rate of getting correct answers from ChatGPT is too low, the posting of answers created by ChatGPT is substantially harmful to the site and to users who are asking or looking for correct answers.\u201d For Stack Overflow, the issue is literally existential. If the website is flooded with worthless code examples, programmers will no longer go there, its database of over 30 million questions and answers will become untrustworthy, and the 14 year old website will die. As one of the most central resources that the world\u2019s programmers rely on, the consequences for software quality and developer productivity could be immense.And Stack Overflow is a canary in a coal mine. They may be able to get their users to stop voluntarily; programmers, by and large, are not malicious, and perhaps can be coaxed to stop fooling around. But Stack Overflow is not Twitter, Facebook, or the web at large.Nation-states and other bad actors that deliberately produce propaganda, are highly unlikely to voluntarily put down their new arms. Instead, they are likely to use large language models as a new class of automatic weapons, in their war on truth, attacking social media and crafting fake web sites at a volume we have never seen before. For them, the hallucinations and occasional unreliabilities of large language models are not an obstacle, but a virtue.The so-called Russian Firehose of Propaganda model, described in a 2016 Rand report, is about creating a fog of misinformation; it focuses on volume, and on creating uncertainty. It doesn\u2019t matter if the \u201clarge language models\u201d are inconsistent, if they can greatly escalate volume.\u00a0And it\u2019s clear that that is exactly what large language models make possible. They are aiming to create a world in which we are unable to know what we can trust; with these new tools, they might succeed.Scam artists too, are presumably taking note, since they can use large language models to create whole rings of fake sites, some geared around questionable medical advice, in order to sell ads; a ring of false sites about Mayim Bialek allegedly selling CBD gummies may be part of one such effort.\u00a7All of this raises a critical question: what can society do about this new threat? Where the technology itself can no longer be stopped, I see four paths, none easy, not exclusive, all urgent:First, every social media company and search engine should support and extend StackOverflow\u2019s ban; automatically-generated content that is misleading, should not be welcome, and the regular posting of it should be grounds for a user\u2019s removal.Second, every country is going to need to reconsider its policies on misinformation. It\u2019s one thing for the occasional lie to slip through; it\u2019s another for us all to swim in a veritable ocean of lies. In time, though it would not be a popular decision, we may have to begin to treat misinformation as we do libel, making it actionable if it is created with sufficient malice and sufficient volume.  Third, provenance is more important now than ever before. User accounts must be more strenuously validated, and new systems like Harvard and Mozilla\u2019s human-ID.org that allow for anonymous, bot-resistant authentication need to become mandatory; they are no longer a luxury we can afford to wait on.Fourth, we are going to need to build a new kind of AI to fight what has been unleashed. Large language models are great at generating misinformation, but poor at fighting it.\u00a0That means we need new tools. Large language models lack mechanisms for verifying truth; we need to find new ways to integrate them with the tools of classical AI, such as databases, webs of knowledge, and reasoning.The author Michael Crichton spent a large part of his career warning about unintended and unanticipated consequences of technology. Early in the film Jurassic Park, before the dinosaurs unexpectedly start running free, scientist Ian Malcom (played by Jeff Goldblum) distills Crichton\u2019s wisdom in a single line \u201cYour scientists were so preoccupied with whether they could, they didn\u2019t stop to think if they\u00a0should.\u201d\u00a0Executives at Meta and OpenAI are as enthusiastic about their tools as the proprietors of Jurassic Park were about theirs.The question is, what are we going to do about it.Gary Marcus (@garymarcus)\u00a0is a scientist, best-selling author, and entrepreneur.

ChatGPT generates strings based on combinations of words from its training data. When it sometimes appears to say things that are correct and sensible when a human makes sense of them, that's only by chance.\n\n>>3:47 AM \u2219 Dec 1, 202225Likes3RetweetsI beg to differ. Chance is definitely part of what\u2019s going on. But it\u2019s not quite the right way to understand the juxtaposition of brilliance and stupidity that we see within GPT. Monkeys and typewriters would be no more likely to create Rtomb\u2019s fluent churro-surgery invention than they would be to write Hamlet. Either could happen, but if you relied on chance alone, you would likely be waiting billions of year, even with a lot of monkeys and a lot of human readers sorting wheat from chaff. The impressive thing about GPT is that it spits out hundreds of perfectly fluent, often plausible prose at a regular clip, with no human filtering required.GPT is not (ever) giving us random characters (JK@#L JKLJFH SDI VHKS) like monkeys and typewriters might. And it\u2019s pretty rarely if ever putting out word salad (book solider girl the gave hungry blue 37). Blaming it all on chance just doesn\u2019t capture what\u2019s going.  Almost everything it says is fluent and at least vaguely plausible.What\u2019s really happening is more subtle than Bender lets on. The real answer comes in two parts.\u00a7Part I:GPT-3 has no idea how the world works (and on this Bender and I would agree); when it says that the \u201ccompact size [of Churros] allows for greater precision and control during surgery, risking the risk of complications and improving the overall outcomes patients\u201d it\u2019s not because it has done a web search for Churros and surgery (good luck with that!). And it\u2019s not because it has reasoned from first principles about the intersection between Churro\u2019s and surgical procedures (clearly it\u2019s pretty shaky on the concept).It\u2019s because GPT-3 is the king of pastiche.Pastiche, in case you don\u2019t know the word, is, as wiki defines it, \u201ca work of visual art, literature, theatre, music, or architecture that imitates the style or character of the work of one or more other artists\u201d. GPT-3 is a mimic.But it is mimic that knows not whereof  it speaks. Merely knowing that it is a mimic, though true, still doesn\u2019t quite get us to the explanation that we need. I think about the rest of the answer in two parts:Part I is about how GPT worksKnowledge is in part about specific properties of particular entities. GPT\u2019s mimicry draws on vast troves of human text that, for example, often put together subjects [England] with predicates [won 5 Eurovision contests]. Over the course of training, GPT sometimes loses track of the precise relations (\u201cbindings\u201d, to use a technical term) between those entities and their properties. GPT\u201ds heavy use of a technique called embeddings makes it really good at substituting synonyms and more broadly related phrases, but the same tendency towards substitution often lead it astray.It never fully masters abstract relationship. It doesn\u2019t know for example, in a fully general way that for all countries A and all B, if country A won more games than country B, country is a better candidate for \u201ccountry that won the most games\u201d (The fact that standard neural networks have trouble with this was the central claim of my 2001 book The Algebraic Mind; recent careful studies with arithmetic shows that such universal knowledge remains a stick pointing for current neural networksPart II is about how humans work.The immense database of things that GPT draws on consists entirely of language uttered by humans, in the real world with utterances that (generally) grounded in the real world. That means, for examples, that the entities (churros, surgical tools) and properties (\u201callow[s] for greater precision and control during surgery, risking the risk of complications and improving the overall outcomes patients\u201d) generally refer to real entities and properties in the world.  GPT doesn\u2019t talk randomly, because it\u2019s pastiching things actual people said. (Or, more often, synonyms and paraphrases of those things.)When GPT gets things right, it is often combining bits that don\u2019t belong together, but not quite in random ways, but rather in ways where there is some overlap in some aspect or another.Example:  Churros are in a cluster of small things that the system (roughly speaking) groups together, presumably including eg baseballs, grasshoppers, forceps, and so forth. GPT doesn\u2019t actually know which of the elements appropriately combine with which other properties.  Some small things really do \u201callow[s] for greater precision and control during surgery, risking the risk of complications and improving the overall outcomes patients\u201d But GPT idea has no idea which. In some sense, GPT is like a glorified version of cut and paste, where everything that is cut goes through a paraphrasing/synonymy process before it is paste but together\u2014and a lot of important stuff is sometimes lost along the way. When GPT sounds plausible, it is because every paraphrased bit that it pastes together is grounded in something that actual humans said, and there is often some vague (but often irrelevant) relationship between.. At least for now, it still takes a human to know which plausible bits actually belong together.ShareP.S. If you haven\u2019t already read my essay Deep Learning is Hitting a Wall  please take a look.

Cicero the computer program, \u00a0announced in an article in Science on November 22, is a powerful AI system that plays Diplomacy; its implications for AI are not yet clear three days later, and may not be for a long time.Diplomacy, a complex game that requires extensive communication,  has been recognized as a challenge for AI for at least fifty years.  To win, a player must not only play strategically, but form alliances, negotiate, persuade, threaten, and occasionally deceive. It therefore presents challenges for AI that are go far beyond those faced either by systems that play games like Go and chess or by chatbots that engage in dialog in less complex settings. The results themselves are, without question, genuinely impressive. Although the AI is not yet at or near world champion level, the system was able to integrate language with game play, in an online version of  blitz Diplomacy, ranking within the top 10% of mixed crowd of professional and amateurs, with play and language use that were natural enough that only one human player suspected it of being a bot.  Lots of questions arise: How does it work? Does it have implications for other ongoing challenges in AI? Is it, as Meta AI\u2019s blog claims, \u201ca breakthrough toward building AI that has mastered the skills\u201d of negotiation, persuasion, and cooperation with people\u201d? How much of an advance is it toward a system that can actually interact intelligently with human beings in real situations? Do we have to worry that Meta has built an AI that can manipulate people to achieve its goal of world domination, as a friend of ours posted, perhaps half-seriously?\u00a0 Are we at some kind of newfound risk given that deception is involved? Meta AI, to its credit, has published the code for Cicero open-source so that the research community can begin to explore these questions.In AI, it\u2019s always hard to answer questions about implications without first looking at a system\u2019s architecture. As it turns out, the architecture of Cicero differs profoundly from most of what\u2019s been talked about in recent years in AI.The first thing to realize is that Cicero is a very complex system. Its high-level structure is considerably more complex than systems like AlphaZero, which mastered Go and chess, or GPT-3 which focuses purely on sequences of words. \u00a0Some of that complexity is immediately apparent in the flowchart; whereas a lot of recent models are something like data-in, action out, with some kind of unified system (say a Transformer) in between, Cicero is heavily prestructured, in advance of any learning or training, with a carefully-designed bespoke architecture that is divided into multiple modules and streams, each with their own specialization.And that\u2019s just the start of the complexity. Many of Cicero\u2019s most important features, in terms of evaluating its overall significance, lie in details buried deep within the article\u2019s supplementary material. Although we aim to spare you most of the detail, it is clear that understanding Cicero properly and answering these questions unavoidably requires a careful analysis. \u00a0How Cicero plays DiplomacyThe game of Diplomacy consists of a series of turns. In each turn, first all the players communicate privately, one-on-one; they can make secret alliances, negotiate terms, threaten repercussions, and so on. When the discussions are complete, they all privately decide on a move, and they announce their moves simultaneously. (The contest was a \u201cblitz\u201d version of the game, limited to five minutes a move, which favors computers, since the blitz version is presumably less dialogue- and negotiation-intensive than the full version of the game; in a longer version of the game, humans may still dominate.)At each move, Cicero must decide who it will talk to, and what it will say, and what move it will make at the end. Each of these decisions depend on the current state of play, including the past history both of play and of communications, and on what other players say to it during the current move.Making the right decision here can get enormously complicated. If you are playing Diplomacy, what you should do as its next action obviously depends on what the other players are going do. And what they are going to do depends on what they think you are \u00a0going to do. To make it more complicated, you can (hopefully) gauge what they are going to do by what they say and you can influence what they are going to do by what you say. But the choice of what you are going to say is determined by what you want them to do which circles back to the question of what you are going to do.\u00a0Luckily for the Cicero team, game theory, first developed in the 1930s, and now \u00a0very powerful, offered a strong starting point. \u00a0The game theory literature figures prominently in how Cicero chooses its strategy. This was already well developed in Meta AI\u2019s earlier\u00a0 work on a simplified version of Diplomacy that was non-linguistic. \u00a0That in itself was impressive. But game theory is a theory of actions; it is not at all a theory of language. In the new work, the Cicero team had to combine game-theoretic strategizing with natural language technology that has been developed for purely linguistic tasks, such translation or question answering. Putting all this together into a coordinated whole was extremely challenging. We are frankly impressed that the Meta AI team pulled it off.It was perhaps inevitable then that the architecture of Cicero during play consists of a collection of highly complex, interacting algorithms. We are not going to attempt to describe it fully here, but we see two key takeaways. The first is that Cicero\u2019s overall architecture Is not something that simply emerged spontaneously from the basic data, but it is rather an exquisitely engineered structure with many moving parts, laboriously worked out by a broad team of different types of AI experts, combining techniques from game theory with probabilistic analysis.The second takeaway is that Cicero leverages many different kinds of information in making its decisions. These include\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The current state of play in the game.\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The history of all the previous moves and all the previous dialogue\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Knowledge of language patterns, based on a purely linguistic model similar to GPT-3. This gives Cicero some idea of what is a reasonable way to respond to communications from the other players.\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Knowledge of how sentences are related to actions. This gives Cicero some idea of how to tell allies or prospective allies what it is planning to do.\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How much time (in seconds) passes between messages.Importantly, although Cicero plays against humans, it doesn\u2019t work in precisely the same ways as humans. For example, human players presumably try to categorize the mental state and the social interactions of the other players.\u00a0 \u201cEngland wants Netherland to support Belgium\u201d, \u201cFrance thinks that Belgium is moving to Holland\u201d, \u201cIf I threaten Germany then they may agree to support Holland or they may form a defensive alliance with Russia\u201d,and so on. Cicero manages to succeed without directly formulating or representing these kinds of thoughts. (To take another example, because of the well-known tendency of LLMs to hallucinate, Cicero sends every proposed message through a filter, to remove inappropriate, hallucinatory, or otherwise flawed utterances\u2014a step that is presumably largely unnecessary for humans.)How Cicero is trainedLike virtually all other current practical AIs, the construction of Cicero makes substantial use of machine learning technology. The training data had a number of different parts, some of which involve substantial labor to create. The system ultimately relied on four classes of bespoke data, far more variegated than one finds in typical deep learning systems, with a fair amount of hand-constructed data (also rare in the deep learning world):\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A corpus of 125,300 human games played on the online platform (of these 40,400 included dialogue, with a total of 12,900,000 individual messages).\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A large language model that appears to have been trained on billions of words, further fine-tuned on the corpus of game dialogue.\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thousands of expert-generated annotations, evaluating the quality of messages produced by a preliminary version of Cicero.\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A large collection of synthetic data sets, many of which were hand-constructed, for training various modules. For instance, to train the filter that excludes invalid messages, they created a hand-constructed collection of invalid messages. Another data set trained Cicero out of its propensity to miscount the entities on the board; still another was designed to improve its understanding of negation. A corpus of games of self-play was used for reinforcement learning, and so on.With that carefully-engineered data all in hand, the system needed to learn what messages in language mean in terms of game actions; it needed\u00a0 to learn, for example, that the sequence of words \u201cDo you want to support Netherlands in Belgium?\u201d means the action marked in the game play as \u201cNTH S BEL\u201d. To do this, Cicero made the assumption that, generally speaking, the sentences in the dialogue between A and B referred to the actions which A and B carried out at the end of the dialogue.\u00a0 (Cleverly, the system looked in the later conversation for claims of dishonesty.\u00a0 If B said to A at some point\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou lied to me last turn\u201d, then that indicated that A\u2019s statements to B on the previous turn should not be annotated with A\u2019s actual move.)Getting all this to work together is amazing.Scope and LimitsCicero is in many ways a marvel; it has achieved by far the deepest and most extensive integration of language and action in a dynamic world of any AI system built to date. It has also succeeded in carrying out complex interactions with humans of a form not previously seen.But it is also striking in how it does that. Strikingly, and in opposition to much of the Zeitgeist, \u00a0Cicero relies quite heavily on hand-crafting, both in the data sets, and in the architecture; in this sense it is in many ways more reminiscent of classical \u201cGood Old Fashioned AI\u201d than deep learning systems that tend to be less structured, and less customized to particular problems. There is far more innateness here than we have typically seen in recent AI systemsAlso, it is worth noting that some aspects of Cicero use a neurosymbolic approach to AI,\u00a0 such as the association of messages in language with symbolic representation of actions, the built-in (innate) understanding of dialogue structure, the nature of lying as a phenomenon that modifies the significance of utterances, and so forth.That said, it\u2019s less clear to us how generalizable the particulars of Cicero are.\u00a7So far as we know, Cicero has been tested only on the single task, the very task that it was carefully crafted to do: playing blitz Diplomacy. It could not be immediately applied to the challenge of, say, customer service or guiding the actions of a domestic robot, or well, almost anything else, really. Even within the world of Diplomacy, the scope is somewhat limited. Human players for example can probably cope well when with an alternative board (the map of Europe as of 1400, say)) or with slightly revised rules for actions (e.g. forces that could travel by air rather than just land or sea ). In Cicero, there is no simple way to \u201cpresent\u201d any such rule or map changes, and its training is very heavily tied bound to the language describing actions specifics of the standard Diplomacy board; how much would carry over is unclear. Our best guess is that if you played Diplomacy with alternative rules, the system would like to have retrained almost from scratch,And there is no easy way to retrain Cicero. If you wanted to build a version of AlphaZero that plays on a 20x20 Go board, that can be done with very little new human labor, since AlphaZero is trained entirely on self-play. With Cicero, you would have to wait until humans had played 125,000 games to retrain on, before you could get on with the experiment.None of this suggests an easy road adapting Cicero to other tasks. The critical question that arises, as is so often the case in AI, \u00a0is, to what extent do the techniques that have been used in Cicero generalize to other situations involving action and social interactions? What aspects of Cicero\u2019s execution architecture, training architecture, or general methodological approach will be useful if we want to build an AI that is useful for some complex interaction with people outside the closed and limited world of Diplomacy?\u00a0 The system is complex enough that we can\u2019t predict \u00a0this with any great confidence, but as things stand now, the prospects for generalization seem to us to be somewhat limited; the style of work might well be useful in other problems, but it may be that not much of the specifics of the architecture would survive if the system were applied to other problems, such as bidding in games like bridge, , or negotiating a work schedule for a team working on a project, or planning a wedding.What does Cicero\u2019s success indicate about AI in general?Cicero makes extensive use of machine learning, but is hardly a poster child for simply making ever bigger models (so-called \u201cscaling maximalism\u201d), nor for the currently popular view of \u201cend-to-end\u201d machine learning of in which some single general learning algorithm applies across the board, with little internal structure and zero innate knowledge. At execution time, Cicero consists of a complex array of separate hand-crafted modules with complex interactions. At training time, it draws on a wide range of training materials, some built by experts specifically for Cicero, some synthesized in programs hand-crafted by experts.The same day that Cicero was announced, there was a friendly debate at the AACL conference on the topic \"Is there more to NLP [natural language processing] than Deep Learning,\u201d \u00a0with four distinguished researchers trained some decades ago arguing the affirmative and four brilliant young researchers more recently trained arguing the negative. Cicero is perhaps a reminder that there is indeed a lot more to natural language processing than deep learning.Our final takeaway? We have known for some time that machine learning is valuable; but too often nowadays ML is a taken as universal solvent\u2014as if the rest of AI was irrelevant\u2014and left to do everything on its own. Cicero may change that calculus. If Cicero is any guide, machine learning may ultimately prove to be even more valuable if it is embedded in highly structured systems, with a fair amount of innate, sometimes neurosymbolic machinery.ShareSubscribe"}

Sometimes there are no right answers, or at least none that we can know right now. Sometimes that\u2019s because (as philosophers like to say), \u201cthere is no fact of the matter,\u201d and sometimes because some important bits of information aren\u2019t yet known, or are not current accessible to us, given our current understanding of science or the state of contemporary technology, and so forth. Consciousness is probably like that; we probably can\u2019t really answer the questions we are striving for, at least not yet; we have to satisfy ourselves with trying to understand the arguments clearly. Michaels taught me that lesson with a single comment on course assignment, which I think was my third of the semester, Up to that point I had written two forceful, take-no-prisoners arguments about philosophy of mind. I thought I was convincing; Michaels was less persuaded. The third one was a dialogue; now you\u2019re talking, she said. You\u2019re finally giving justice to both sides of the argument.Earlier today, I accidentally co-wrote a short but provocative dialogue, wholly unexpectedly, with someone I didn\u2019t really expect to talk much with at all. Anil Seth, who studies consciousness (and recently wrote a fabulous book on the topic), had  tweeted something about the terms consciousness and awareness that reminded me to ask Blake Lemoine\u2014the former Google Engineer who claimed that LaMDA was sentient\u2014for his take on Galactica.

But this time he bit, and gave an intriguing answer:Blake Lemoine @cajundiscordian@GaryMarcus Sentience in large part is about self knowledge, an understanding of the nature of oneself and your relations to others.  I'm not sure I've seen any evidence that Galactica has that kind of holistic understanding of what it is.5:22 PM \u2219 Nov 23, 20224Likes2RetweetsBy DM I told him I liked his answer, and next thing you know, we were talking.

I will give five answers of my own, below (but you can pause here if you want to take a guess, yourself).\u00a7Let\u2019s start with some answers that probably aren\u2019t right.Could it be that nobody at Amazon has read the recent literature? Almost certainly not. Amazon probably *is* using large language models for product search. (This may be why you often get good results for synonyms and typos, but also get a lot of stuff you don't want, like asking for AAA batteries and getting a bunch of C batteries mixed in). Yet Alexa obviously isn't conversing in the way that GPT-3 is. Another theory?  Maybe Amazon doesn't want to pay the licensing fees. Nope, that's not it either; they could easily spin up an instance of an LLM on AWS, and probably afford the cost (one-time training is expensive, runtime less so). And I don\u2019t think scaling is the real issue either. Amazon\u2019s engineers are Masters of Scale, and certainly the company doesn\u2019t lack for processing power or data, either.Here are my five best guesses; I suspect all five contributed:LLMs are inherently unreliable. If Alexa were to make frequent errors, people would stop using it. Amazon would rather you trust Alexa for a few things like timers and music than sell you a system with much broader scope that you stop trusting and stop using.LLMs are unruly beasts; nobody knows how to make them refrain 100% of time from insulting users, giving bad advice, or just plain making stuff up. (Galactica was an epic failure in this regard.)Amazon doesn't want to get sued. Any one of these scenarios of LLMs gone awry  (bad advice, insults, lies etc) could hurt the Amazon brand, open up litigation, etc.. It's just not worth the risk.Alexa has to do stuff in the world, like turning on lights, playing music, opening shades, etc; if Alexa could converse freely, user expectations would go through the roof, and mostly be unmeetable. (You could tell Alexa to wash the dishes, but until their robot division really picks up speed, that ain\u2019t happening.)LLMs spit our words, not actions (and not API calls either). When an LLM produces a sentence, you can't directly use that sentence to control stuff, unless you build another system to parse the sentences into actions. Nobody knows how to do this reliably, either.Bottom line: From the outset Large Language Models like GPT-3 have great at generating surrealist prose, and they can beat a lot of benchmarks, but they are not (and may never be) great tech for reliably inferring user intent from what users say.Turning LLMs into a product\u00a0 that controls your home and talks to you in a way that would be reliable enough to use at scale in millions of homes is still a long, long way away. See also my essay on Google\u2019s Palm-SayCan, for what might happen if this tech were embedded in robots, which would be even more risky.For more analysis of where AI is and how we might eventually get to AGI\u2013 and what risks we might encounter along the way, please subscribe (free!):Subscribe.

I called this hypothesis\u2014that AGI might arise from larger scale without fundamental new innovation\u2014 \u201cscaling-\u00fcber-alles\u201d. I pointed out many problems; de Freitas never replied.His hypothesis, now generally called scaling maximalism, remains extremely popular, in no small part because bigger and bigger models have indeed continued to do ever more impressive things. So far.  The trouble of course is that months or even years of going up and up on some measures still does not in fact remotely entail that scale is all we need. Ponzi schemes go up and up until they explode. Scaling is an empirical observation, not a guaranteed, continued law of nature. This week I saw not one but three striking premonitions for how the scaling maximalism hypothesis might end.There might not be enough data in the world to make scaling maximalism work. A bunch of people have already worried about this. This week saw a formal proof by William Merrill, Alex Warstadt, and Tal Linzen  arguing that \u201ccurrent neural LMs are not well suited\u201d to extracting natural language semantics \u201cwithout an infeasible amount of data\u201d.\u00a0 The proof makes too many assumptions to be taken as gospel, but if it is even close to correct, there may soon be real trouble in Scaling City.There might not be enough available compute in the world to make scaling maximalism feasible. Also this very week, Miguel Solano sent me a manuscript, (to which I am now contributing, along with Maria Elena Solano) that argues that scaling the current meta benchmark du jour, Big Bench, would require just over one-fourth of the U.S.\u2019s entire electricity consumption in 2022. Some important tasks might simply not scale. The most vivid illustration of this is a linguistics task by Ruis, Khan, Biderman, Hooker, Rockt\u00e4schl, and Grefenstette examining the pragmatic implications of language (e.g., quoting from their paper, \u201cwe intuitively understand the response \u201cI wore gloves\u201d to the question \u201cDid you leave fingerprints?\u201d as meaning \u201cNo.\u201d). As I have long argued, capturing this without cognitive models and common sense is really hard. Scaling here was largely AWOL; even the best model was only at 80.6%, and for most models, scaling had at best a neglible effect. As the lead author, Laura Ruis, has pointed out to me, a more complex version of the task can easily be imagined; performance there would be presumably even lower. What hit me hard, as I was reading the paper, is that asymptotic 80% performance  on even a single important task like this might spell game over for scaling.  If you get syntax and semantics but fail on pragmatics or commonsense reasoning, you don\u2019t have AGI you can trust. Moore\u2019s Law didn\u2019t carry us as far and as fast as some people initially hoped, because it is not actually a causal law of the universe.  Scaling maximalism is an interesting hypothesis, but I stand by my prediction that it won\u2019t get us to AGI.  This week rendered vivid three possible failure modes. Any one of them would mean we need a real paradigm shift, if we are to get to AGI.  All of this points to the same conclusion: if we want to reach AGI we shouldn\u2019t keep putting so many eggs in the scaling-\u00fcber-alles basket.Thanks for reading The Road to AI We Can Trust!

Regardless of what the empirical facts are for biology, it should be obvious even from the armchair that one could in principle believe, e.g., in both the existence of innateness and learning.And  in fact, literally everyone I know does. None of the myths relate to positions that anyone in the real world holds. For example, I am not aware of anybody who believes in innateness and yet denies that learning is important.\u00a0 Certainly all the outspoken nativists I know (Chomsky, Pinker, Spelke, Gallistel, myself, the late Jerry Fodor, etc) are all perfectly happy to recognize that some sorts of learning take place, even as we all also think that some important part of human mental machinery is built-in, in sense of naturally arising via the processes of developmental biology, independently of specific experience.1Take Chomsky, often characterized as the ultimate arch nativist. Chomsky\u2019s argument for a Language Acquisition Device is, actually, on close inspection, an argument for (a specialized) learning mechanism. Chomsky\u2019s LADis not mind you,  simple stimulus-response-reinforcement, deep reinforcement learning, or back-propagation, or anything else currently fashionable, but it is still a form of learning in which various parameters of a child\u2019s mind are set in specific ways, based on data. Now Chomsky\u2019s notion of learning may, perhaps, be more like a newborn chick\u2019s imprinting than Skinnerian conditioning, but it is still learning just the same, setting parameters based on data. That\u2019s what learning is, tuning parameters to data, and even Chomsky thinks we do some of that. (He  just happens to think that innate constraints play in role in the process that tunes the parameters.)Likewise, Fodor\u2019s argument in The Language of Thought that concepts must be acquired through some sort of innate primitives and innate combinatorial apparatus doesn\u2019t deny learning. It just holds that whatever concepts are acquired-which is to say learned\u2014are learned via application of the aforementioned combinatorial apparatus. Pinker\u2019s theory of semantic bootstrapping, likewise, is in part a theory of how some modest bits of innate knowledge about language universals might allow a child to fill in\u2014learn\u2014the rest. Spelke\u2019s Core Knowledge theory is a theory about how Core Knowledge bootstraps other knowledge, and so on. Gallistel is as nativist as they come, and wrote a whole book called The Organization of Learning.In fact, the more you like learning, the more you should embrace innateness, because part of what you should be embracing is what Peter Marler called innately-guided learning, a rubric that describes each of theories I just discussed. The more of that you have, the more you can probably learn. A beautiful example of innately-guided learning is the \u201cGarcia effect\u201d, otherwise known as learned taste aversion. Taste something, and get sick soon afterwards, and you will avoid that taste for a very long time. The neural mechanisms for that represent an innate, domain-specific adaptation for learning a very specific type of information. (The imprinting of a chick on its best nearby candidate for mother is another well-known case).  My own guess, based on my reading of the ever-controversial psychology literature, is that humans are likely innately endowed with many learning mechanisms, each with different properties. Some might possibly be tailored to language, others for observational learning, classical conditioning, hypothesis testing, cost-benefit analysis, and so on, perhaps dynamically combined and recombined in various ways in real time.  The very variety of innate learning mechanisms may be central to what makes us humans special.\u00a7In case it is not obvious, I am a card carrying nativist, as enamored with innateness as I am with learning. All of my work, on child language acquisition, generalization in neural networks, my book on developmental biology, etc, have really been about both: about trying to understand how biology (or in the case of machines, prior knowledge) and learning work together. Why am I into both learning and innateness? In large part because I care about what make humans unique. In keeping with the above, the answer almost surely lies with some set of (not-yet -understood)  learning mechanisms that are themselves innate. As Terrace and Pettito and others discovered empirically, if you raise a chimp among humans,  you don\u2019t get a human mind. Chimps lack the correct learning mechanisms; they can\u2019t transform linguistic input into human-level understanding. If chimps and humans were born with the same learning mechanisms, you would expect to find more convergence between them than we actually observe. (Yes, their brains are smaller, but human children have smaller brains than adults, yet outperform the adults at learning language.  Size may be part of it it, but size isn\u2019t everything. What counts is what you do with the neural material you have.) Knowing more about exactly what it is beyond size that makes our mind unique would tell us an immense amount, both about ourselves, and about how we might want to build our AI.\u00a7Not wishing to belabor that which ought to be obvious,  I leave countering the remaining myths as an exercise for the reader to work out. I trust that they are not challenging to refute. (The trickiest is the idea that if you are nativist you necessarily have to believe in innate, domain-specific knowledge; hint: you don\u2019t. To join the club all you have to do is to think that some nontrivial stuff is innate. My own guess: we have a rich mixture of many innate mechanisms, some domain-specific, some domain-general.)I only raise all this because so many people periodically forget a fundamental fact: learning and innateness are not and need not be mortal enemies.Except for advanced learning mechanisms that are themselves learned (like the value of spaced practice, or ways of analyzing a book, eg starting from a perusal of the table of contents), most learning mechanisms themselves probably are innate.If you believe in learning, you ought believe that your learning mechanisms come from somewhere. On pain of infinite regress, at least one of those learning mechanisms must be innate. So unless you believe in magic, you are already, like it or not, a nativist.CodaGood news for those who find any of the above upsetting: You can always redefine your problems away!  For example, you can maximally narrow the definition of information and argue that DNA doesn\u2019t contain information (somebody actually tried to tell me this a few days ago) or that DNA contains no information about phenotypes (somebody else tried to tell me this the next day). Alternatively, you can take a maximally broad definition of learning and include under that umbrella literally anything that might be innate by dint of evolution, and call that learning too!  (Honestly, someone last week tried to tell me that the structure of the hand was learned; I am not making this stuff up!)  But wait, that\u2019s not all. You can also broaden the term empiricism to include every possible process, and narrow the term nativism to only include literal neural blueprints for entire brains. Or even do both at once! Narrow nativism AND broaden empiricism, and you are guaranteed to have everything line up on your side of the argument! Schopenhauer couldn\u2019t have said it better.Subscribe for free:Subscribe1A somewhat more technical way of putting the innateness hypothesis is to say that some important aspects of mental structure are partly shaped by the influence of inherited information\u2014that is, information that was present before ontogeny (e.g., in DNA)\u2014on the structure of the phenotype, as opposed to a view in which all mental structure was shaped by experience with no influence from genetic contributions."}

It never surprises me when The New York Times says that a revolution is coming, and the promised revolution doesn\u2019t materialize. That\u2019s been happening for a long time.  Decades, in fact.Consider, for example, what John Markoff said in 2011 about IBM Watson.\u201cFor I.B.M., the showdown was not merely a well-publicized stunt and a $1 million prize, but proof that the company has taken a big step toward a world in which intelligent machines will understand and respond to humans, and perhaps inevitably, replace some of them.\u201dThat hasn\u2019t come to pass. Eleven years later, comprehension is still lacking (see any of my recent essays here) and very few if any  jobs have actually been replaced by AI. Every truck I know is still driven by a person (except in some limited-use test pilots), and no radiologists have yet been replaced.  Watson itself was recently sold for parts. Then again, the Times first said neural networks were on the verge of solving AI in 1958; forecasting AI just doesn\u2019t seem to be the Times\u2019 strong point. Fine.But this last few days I have seen a whole bunch of similarly overenthused claims from serious researchers that ought to know better. Example one, the least objectionable of the three, but nonetheless a sign of the overgenerous times, came from Stanford economist Erik Brynjolfsson:Erik Brynjolfsson @erikbryn@grsimari @GaryMarcus Or another way is that I have seen many different types of narrow intelligences, some of which are superhuman in their specific domains.\n\nHuman intelligence is (probably) \"broader\" than all the others currently, but still only a very narrow slice of the space of intelligences.3:49 PM \u2219 Oct 14, 2022Brynjolfsson is totally correct that human intelligence is a very narrow slice of the space of possible intelligences (that\u2019s a point Chomsky has been making about human language since before I was born). Undoubtedly clever intelligences than ours are possible and may yet materialize.But\u2014hold up\u2014what the heck is the hedging word probably doing here, even in parentheses?  Any normal 5-year-old can hold a conversation about just about anything in a native language that they have acquired language more or less from scratch just a couple years earlier,  climb  an unfamiliar jungle gym, follow the plot of a new cartoon, or acquire the rules of new card games verbally, without tens of thousands of trials, etc, pretty much endlessly. Human children are constantly learning new things, often from tiny amounts of data. There is literally nothing like that in the AI world.  Hedging with probably makes it sounds like we think there is a viable competitor out there for human general intelligence in the AI world. There isn\u2019t.1 It would be like me saying Serena Williams could probably beat me in tennis.\u00a7Yann LeCun meanwhile has been issuing a series of puzzling tweets claiming that convnets, which he invented, (\u201cor whatever\u201d),  can solve pretty much everything, which isn\u2019t true and ostensibly   contradicts what he himself told ZDNet a couple weeks ago.    But wait, it gets worse. LeCun went on to  write the following, which really left me scratching my head:Yann LeCun @ylecun@erikbryn The problems to solve to make progress in AI are *exactly* the same whether you  want to augment human workers or replace them.9:27 PM \u2219 Oct 13, 202239Likes3RetweetsWell, no.  Augmentation is way easier, because you don\u2019t have to solve the whole job. A calculator augments an accountant; it doesn\u2019t figure out what is deductible or where there might be a loophole in a tax code. We know how to build machines that do math (augmentation); we don\u2019t know how to build machines that can read tax codes (replacement).  Or consider radiology:  Gary Marcus @GaryMarcus@warren_craddock @ylecun @erikbryn @DrHughHarvey @DrLaurenOR @maxaltl @zakkohane the job of a radiologist includes not just reading images (which convnets are suited to but (in some cases) reasoning about a patient\u2019s history and reading unstructured text, two problems for which convnets are less suited. cc @AMPimaging3:36 AM \u2219 Oct 14, 2022Medical AI overwhelmingly and unanimously weighed on my side of the argument:Anand Prabhakar, MD, MBA @AMPimaging@GaryMarcus @warren_craddock @ylecun @erikbryn @DrHughHarvey @DrLaurenOR @maxaltl @zakkohane Correct!

As Matthew Fenech, Co-founder and Chief Medical Officer @una_health put this morning, \u201cto argue for radiologist replacement in anything less than the medium term is to fundamentally misunderstand their role.\u201d\u00a7But these are just off the cuff tweets. Perhaps we can forgive their hasty generosity. I was even more astonished by a massive statistical mistake in deep learning\u2019s favor in an article in one of the Nature journals, on the neuroscience of language. The article is by (inter alia) some MetaAI researchers:Charlotte Caucheteux @c_caucheteux\ud83e\udd16\ud83e\udde0 Our latest paper is now out:\n\nnature.com/articles/s4159\u2026\n\n\u201cDeep language algorithms predict semantic comprehension from brain activity\u201d, by @c_caucheteux, @agramfort & @JeanRemiKing\n \nThe summary thread below below\ud83d\udc47\n\n1/n 2:33 PM \u2219 Oct 11, 2022619Likes127RetweetsOstensibly the result is great news for deep learning fans, revealing correlations between deep learning and human brain. The lead author claimed on Twitter in the same thread that there were \u201cdirect [emphasis added] links\u201d  between the \u201cinner workings\u201d of GPT2 and the human brain:Charlotte Caucheteux @c_caucheteuxNo doubt that modern algorithms have a long way to go before understanding language like we do. \n\nStill, the direct links found between their inner workings and those of the human brain provide an exciting platform to understand (and improve!) these two systems.\n\n8/n2:33 PM \u2219 Oct 11, 202219Likes1RetweetBut the fine print matters; what we see is merely a correlation, and the correlation that is observed is  decent but hardly decisive,  R = 0.50. That\u2019s  enough to get you published, but it also means there\u2019s a lot that you don\u2019t know. When two variables are correlated like that, it doesn\u2019t mean A causes B (or vice versa); it doesn\u2019t even mean they are in lockstep.  It is akin to the magnitude of the correlation between height and weight; if I know your height and nothing else about you: I can make a slightly educated guess about your weight. I might be close, but I could also be off; there is certainly no guarantee. The paper itself addresses this, but when it does, it makes a gaping mistake, erring, again on the side of attributing too much to deep learning. Here is what they say: (people who know their stats well might spot the error right away).Uh onh As Stats 101 teaches us, the amount of variability explained is not R but rather R squared. So if you have a correlation of R = .5, you actually \u201cexplain\u201d  (really, just \u201cpredict\u201d) only 25% of the variance\u2014which means fully three-quarters (not half) of the variability remains unexplained.  That\u2019s a huge difference. (In a DM, I pointed out the error to the senior author, King, and he concurred, promising he would contact the journal to make a correction.) Predicting a mere 25% of the variance means license to speculate, but it certainly doesn\u2019t mean you have nailed the answer. In the end, all we really have  is evidence that something that matters to GPT also matters to the brain (for example frequency and complexity), but we are very long way from saying that whatever is weakly correlated is actually functioning in the same way in both.  It\u2019s way too much charity to deep learning to claim that there is any kind of direct link. Now here\u2019s the thing. Stuff happens. Scientists are fallible, and good on the senior author for writing to the journal for correction. But the fact this slipped through the peer review process at a journal at Nature astounds me. What it says to me is that people liked the story, and didn\u2019t read very carefully.  (And, hello, reading carefully is the number one job of a peer reviewer. #youhadonejob)When that happens, when reviewers like the story but don\u2019t read critically, it says that they are voting with their hearts, and not their brains.Thanks for reading The Road to AI We Can Trust!

With enough investment, Tesla might in principle catch up. If Musk really wants to win the robotics race,  he has the resources to do so. (Though he clearly has not invested nearly enough so far.)What I didn\u2019t see last night was vision. I mean this in two different senses.First,  there was no clearly outlined vision for what Optimus would do, nor much justification for why Tesla is building the robot the in this specific way. There was no decisive justification for why to use a humanoid robot (rather than e.g. just an arm), no clarity about the first big application, no clear go-to-market strategy, and no clear product differentiator. It was the kind of thing you see in a seed stage robotics startup, but it was surprising coming from the CEO at at one of the world\u2019s largest companies. There was a lot of bluster (we will 100x the world\u2019s productivity) but no road map. Second, there was  very little vision for how Tesla would build the cognitive part of the AI they will need, beyond the basics of motor control (which Boston Dynamics already does so well), nor much recognition about why robotics is so hard in the real world. How will the system decide what is safe and worth doing in a home filled with unfamiliar objects, and humans and pets that are coming and going? How will it keep from wreaking accidental mayhem? How will it understand the difference between what people say and what they really mean? All there was, really, was a prayer\u2014to the god of big data. At one point, in the question period, Musk argued that Tesla was likely to contribute to AI (and solve whatever needs solving) because it would have the most data and and the compute,  weak version of the implausible alt intelligence hypothesis I discussed in May.To begin with both premises are arguable. Does Tesla actually have more humanoid robotics data than Google or Boston Dynamics do? Certainly not yet. The implied subpremise is that lots of people will buy Tesla\u2019s $20k robot, leading to the collection of a lot of data, but that\u2019s speculative at best, and years away even in an optimistic scenario. (Nobody is paying $20k for what they saw last night.) With respect to raw computational power, Tesla might eventually outgun Boston Dynamics, depending on how things go, but I seriously doubt they could outgun Google if Google went all in on humanoid robotics.  The overall logic is even weaker. The reality is that AI needs genuine, paradigm-shift level innovation. Simply building ever bigger neural networks won\u2019t cut it. The way I put it last night was this:Gary Marcus @GaryMarcus. @elonmusk argues that since @Tesla (supposedly) has the most data and most compute, it follows they will necessarily will contribute to artificial general intelligence.\n\ni disagree w this logic: building biggest model isn\u2019t inherently a contribution to the innovations we need3:56 AM \u2219 Oct 1, 202284Likes10RetweetsBut don\u2019t take my word for it. Here\u2019s deep learning pioneer Yann LeCun giving a a talk earlier this week:Amy Orsborn, PhD \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udd2c\ud83d\udc35 @neuroamyoThe final day of the @uwcnc workshop on neuro-ai kicks off with the one and only Yann LeCun talking about why ML pales in comparison to humans and animal learning. 3:57 PM \u2219 Sep 30, 202245Likes5RetweetsIf you read the top of the slide, it says \u201cMachine Learnings sucks! (compared to humans and animals)\u201d. because it is so slow and inefficient by comparison. LeCun also points out (as too I have often said, eg in this 2015 review with Ernest Davis) that we know far too little about how to to embed common sense into AI. We in AI have a long long way to go. Data and compute alone won\u2019t be enough. Meta, which has more data and compute than almost anyone, has finally woken up to that.  Musk still hasn\u2019t. LeCun would probably agree that addressing common sense is the single biggest challenge facing robotics; without a solution to it, you cannot have humanoid robots in the home and expect them to be safe. We disagree about how to solve the problem, but we both see it as front and center. Musk barely even acknowledged the problem, and certainly didn\u2019t lay out any sort of credible strategy for attacking it..  For me the most worrisome part of last night\u2019s presentation was not the lack of a world-beating demo, but a lack of recognition of what would even be required. In recent interviews (e.g., at TED 2022), Musk has acknowledged that self-driving is a lot harder than he anticipated, and might even be an \u201cAI complete\u201d problem that requires general artificial intelligence. The thing about such problems is, as Wikipedia nicely puts it, \u201cCurrently, AI-complete problems cannot be solved with modern computer technology alone\u201d. Sooner or later he will recognize that humanoid robots, too, pose a whole set of challenges that lie well beyond our current grasp.I admire Musk for trying, but I would have more confidence if I thought he understood more deeply the nature of the challenge.Subscribe for free :Subscribe"}

I am optimistic this is achievable in less than 5 years considering @Tesla innovation in AI space @elonmusk1:28 AM \u2219 Sep 28, 2022My own followers are (perhaps not surprisingly) a bit less sanguine:With tongue slightly in cheek, but genuine skepticism, here my Top 5 reasons why my own expectations are quite low:Reading tea leaves is not really my business, but sometimes the signs seem hard to miss. A couple days Buzzfeed asked Musk for comment, in advance of the announcements. How much progress have you made since last year when you announced the Optimus robot. Musk\u2019  answer\u2014\u201cI hate BuzzFeed with the passion of a thousand suns.\u201d \u2014wasn\u2019t exactly a ringing endorsement.  (Usually CEOs say things like \u201cFantastic! We are really proud of what we will be showing you on Friday!\u201d)Musk is almost never right about deadlines. He been promising driverless cars pretty much ever year since 2014 and still hasn\u2019t yet gotten that project out of beta, and the thing that is in beta isn\u2019t still isn\u2019t really a driverless car  at all, so much as a car that can drive for you some of the time, provided you pay really strict attention all of the time. The fleets of driverless taxis he promised are likely still years or decades away.Musk may well have been scooped! The thing that I suspected Musk most wanted to do has already been done: take a large language model (like GPT-3) and hook it up to robot. That could have made for a cool demo, bu t\u2026 Google just beat him to the punch.  In my view the Google demo is pretty problematic (despite being cool), particularly in terms of likely reliability, but no matter. If Tesla does something similar, nobody knowledgeable will impressed. Last time around, Tesla displayed a person in a robot costume dancing; turning that to real robotic life in itself would mean nothing. Boston Dynamics already knows how to build whole chorus lines full of actual dancing robots (and robots doing parkour and somersaults and so forth). If all we saw was more of the same\u2014 canned demos of amazing physical feats\u2014everyone would yawn. The real challenge is to get a robot to behave flexibly in the real world.  The most important concern is that robotics is always harder than people think it is. To take one example from many, OpenAI made a huge splash with their Rubik\u2019s cube robot demo in October 2019, but apparently shut the whole thing down last year, never shipping anything that looked remotely like a product, despite the immense press. Building robots in the lab is one thing, making them work in the open-ended real world is another. To impress those in the know, you would probably have to show that you had made sort of significant progress towards the so-called Sim2Real problem, of getting simulated robots to work reliably out in the world. Roboticists are likely to scoff unless they see real evidence of progress than on Friday.  That disconnect, between what works in simulation and what happens in the real world, is particularly pernicious\u2014and particularly relevant\u2014if Musk ultimately wants his robots to work in ordinary people\u2019s homes (and ordinary workplaces).  And it here\u2019s where I suspect Musk has gone wrong: techniques that apply to driverless cars (which mostly have to deal with that roads are governed by more or less the same rules wherever you) may have little value in the  varied environments of human homes, which are often littered  with pesky and unpredictable things like stairs and today and pets that pose serious problems for humanoid robots. And you really don\u2019t want Optimus to fall on your cat.The real problem w robots has never been demos, anyway (there have been  many, for decades); it\u2019s making robots in robust in the real world. One more dancing robot wouldn\u2019t tell us much about whether Tesla was close to (say) a real general-purpose domestic robot, and the robotics community would be rightly skeptical if that\u2019s all that we saw.As the excellent journalist James Vincent just put it in his own analysis the real question is not what do we will we see in Friday but rather how deep is the tech. As he put it, when the bot  \u201cis unveiled on Friday, be sure to watch it closely and ask yourself: what am I seeing here, a tech demo or stage show?\u201d That\u2019s what professionals will be doing.None of this is to say that Tesla could not solve all of these problems eventually given enough time and money, but Friday may not be the big demo his fans are hoping for.ShareThanks for reading The Road to AI We Can Trust!

He (or perhaps MetaAI\u2019s PR department) has talked both Technology Review and ZDNet into laudatory profiles, the former entitled Yann LeCun has a bold new vision for the future of AI. Just since the beginning of June, LeCun has also posted a widely-discussed manifesto, and a review of my own work [which differs in some important respects from his] staking out his own position on the important question of symbol-manipulation. But how much of what he is saying is really new?When I read the ZDNet interview, which was published yesterday, I was astounded. And not in a good way. Nearly everything LeCun said, I had said earlier, some almost word for word\u2014most of it in a 2018 paper called Deep Learning: A Critical Appraisal  that LeCun had pilloried at the time as \u201cmostly wrong\u201d. Here are seven examples; as we shall see, this is but one instance of a larger problem.LeCun, 2022: Today's AI approaches will never lead to true intelligence (reported in the headline, not a verbatim quote); Marcus, 2018: \u201cdeep learning must be supplemented by other techniques if we are to reach artificial general intelligence.\u201dLeCun, 2022: [Current Deep learning models] \u201cmay be a component of a future intelligent system, but I think it's missing essential pieces.\"; \u201cI think they're necessary but not sufficient,\"; Marcus 2018: \u201cDespite all of the problems I have sketched, I don\u2019t think that we need to abandon deep learning. Rather, we need to reconceptualize it: not as a universal solvent, but simply as one tool among many, a power screwdriver in a world in which we also need hammers, wrenches, and pliers, not to mentions chisels and drills, voltmeters, logic probes, and oscilloscopes.\u201dLeCun, 2022: Reinforcement learning will also never be enough for intelligence;  Marcus, 2018: \u201c it is misleading to credit deep reinforcement learning with inducing concept[s] \u201dLeCun, 2022: \u201cWe're not to the point where our intelligent machines have as much common sense as a cat,\" observes Lecun. \"So, why don't we start there?\"\u00a0Marcus, 2022: \u201cWhere else should we look [beyond deep learning]? \u2026 A second focal point might be on common sense knowledge\u201dLeCun, 2022: \u201cI think AI systems need to be able to reason,\"; Marcus 2018: \u201cProblems that have less to do with categorization and more to do with commonsense reasoning essentially lie outside the scope of what deep learning is appropriate for, and so far as I can tell, deep learning has little to offer such problems.\u201dLeCun, 2022: \"You have to take a step back and say, Okay, we built this ladder, but we want to go to the moon, and there's no way this ladder is going to get us there\u201d: Marcus, in The New Yorker in 2012: \u201cTo paraphrase an old parable, [with deep learning] Hinton has built a better ladder; but a better ladder doesn\u2019t necessarily get you to the moon.\u201dNobody has ever reprised my own arguments more closely than LeCun did yesterday, much less without attribution. I won\u2019t accuse LeCun of plagiarism, because I think he probably reached these conclusions honestly, after recognizing the failures of current architectures. What I foresaw, he has finally recognized for himself. At some level this is a tremendous victory for me - to have someone so eminent move to a position that I staked out, long ago.  \u00a7But there is more to the story to than that. A lot more.To begin with, LeCun is determined to never be seen as echoing anything I have ever said. Since he very publicly criticized my earlier paper, we know he is aware of it. The  degreee to which LeCun failed to share any credit\u2014an absolute violation of academic etiquette (we\u2019ve both been professors since the \u201890s, though I retired early)\u2014is striking. More than that, to make sure nobody gave me any credit, he took a gratuitious, and completely dishonest potshot at me, in the same interview, alleging, quite falsely \u201cGary Marcus is not an AI person, by the way, he is a psychologist. He has never contributed anything to AI. He's done really good work in experimental psychology but he's never written a peer-reviewed paper on AI\u201d\u2014 which is simply false. In reality, I have published extensively in AI, some in peer-reviewed journals, some not. My most important AI paper, which did experimental work on neural networks, foresaw in 1998  the challenges of distribution shift and outliers that are preoccupying Yoshua Bengio and others now. In the last decade, I have published peer-reviewed AI articles on topics such as common sense, reasoning from incomplete information, and limits of simulation and automatic reasoning, many with the NYU computer scientist Ernest Davis, who happens to be in LeCun\u2019s department. Perhaps my most influential AI work of all happens not to have been a journal article, but a 2001 book The Algebraic Mind (which MIT Press sent out for peer review). Nearly every bit of what LeCun told ZDNet was foreseen there; two leaders in the fast-growing field of neurosymbolic AI have said that they see The Algebraic Mind as vital to their approach. What LeCun really means is that he hasn\u2019t read any of it; the idea that it isn\u2019t influential is laughable. LeCun\u2019s claim was egregious enough that others have come to my defense;  ZDNet posted an immediate correction, and as I was drafting this, Miguel Solano, CEO of Vmind.AI wrote this, backing me up: Miguel Ignacio Solano @miguelisolano@GaryMarcus @ZDNET @TiernanRayTech @ylecun This is true, @ylecun. @GaryMarcus's The Algebraic Mind (MIT Press, 2001), for instance, has 868+ citations, and was certainly engaged in the AI literature: scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=\u20263:28 PM \u2219 Sep 25, 2022Henning Schwabe was even more pointed, building on remarks from Dagmar Monett:Henning Schwabe @SchwabeHenning@ylecun \u2018s unfair attack is tragic b/c it will help DL maximalist to dismiss his critique - he should have allied with @GaryMarcus to further his agenda. Ego as always the enemy of reason. Dagmar Monett @dmonettI found explanations for LeCun's behavior in @Eric_Sadin's \"The Silicolonization of the World\" (2016/2018). See pic & translation.\n\n@ZDNET's interview only reinforces this and leaves him in a terrible position. The audacity... How LeCun refers to other academics and their work \ud83d\ude33 https://t.co/qy3WrIcJAb https://t.co/KlPXhYjNxM4:09 PM \u2219 Sep 25, 20222Likes1RetweetGraduate students sometimes play fast and loose with credit to build themselves up; Harold Bloom once wrote a book about what he called The Anxiety of Influence. Until this year I had never seen anything like this in someone of LeCun\u2019s stature. But this year I have seen it from him, over and over.  \u00a7 Each of LeCun\u2019s recent papers and essays has, in its own way, exhibited the same denial of the past.One essay involved the long standing question of symbol-manipulation. Since I already responded at length in Noema, I will summarize only briefly here. LeCun spent part of his career bashing symbols; his collaborator Geoff Hinton even more so, Their jointly written 2015 review of deep learning ends by saying that they \u201cnew paradigms are needed to replace rule-based manipulation of symbolic expressions.\u201d Nowadays LeCun is endorsing symbol-manipulation (an idea I did not invent but have been defending for 30 years), and acting as if nobody said otherwise\u2014a dispatch from Orwell\u2019s Ministry of Truth. As I put it in Noema, when LeCun and Browning wrote \u201ceveryone working in [Deep Learning] agrees that symbolic manipulation is a necessary feature for creating human-like AI,\u201d they are walking back decades of history. Even Stanford AI Professor Christopher Manning (often closer in his views to LeCun then me) was shocked:Christopher Manning @chrmanningI sense some evolution in @ylecun\u2019s position\u2014perhaps under Browning's influence; this piece suggests that \u201ceveryone working in DL agrees that symbolic manipulation is a necessary feature for creating human-like AI.\u201d Was that really true a decade ago, or is it even true now?!?12:38 AM \u2219 Jul 28, 202223Likes1RetweetWhen I pointed all this out at length,  LeCun\u2019s only response to my lengthy, detailed analysis article, which was fact-checked by Noema, was, well, lame. In lieu of responding, he retweeted a vague, contentless rejoinder written by his co-author:Browning.jake00 @Jake_Browning00A reply to our piece from @GaryMarcus   But I don't think we agree where he says we do, or disagree on where our disagreements are. But that's the nature of difficult issues, I suppose. Noema Magazine @NoemaMagIs a decades-long AI debate finally coming to a resolution?\n\n@garymarcus is seeing signs that it is.\n\nNow \"we can finally focus on the real issue: how to get data-driven learning & abstract, symbolic representations to work together.\"\n\nhttps://t.co/QtaxfAEWdv7:13 PM \u2219 Aug 14, 20228Likes2RetweetsNot one specific objection to anything that I said in my scathing rebuttal.\u00a7Another of LeCun\u2019s recent essays involved the important question of whether large language models are really on the right track to general intelligence, and whether one can really learn enough from language alone. LeCun and his collaborator Browning make a strong case that language input alone (which is the kind of thing that GPT-3 is trained on) is not enough, writing an essay called AI And The Limits Of Language arguing that \u201cA system trained on language alone will never approximate human intelligence, even if trained from now until the heat death of the universe.\u201d But here again there\u2019s a lack of credit. Here for example is something I wrote about the same question in February 2020 in an arXiv artcle called The Next Decade in AI:Waiting for cognitive models and reasoning to magically emerge from larger and larger [language] training corpora is like waiting for a miracle\u2026\u2014 almost exactly what LeCun and Browning concluded. But, no, we are not done.\u00a7The key question is what we as field should do about the fact that you can\u2019t really solve AI from large language models alone. Here was my prescription in January 2020:A system like GPT-2, for instance, does what it does, for better and for worse, without any explicit (in the sense of directly represented and readily shared) common sense knowledge, without any explicit reasoning, and without any explicit cognitive models of the world it that tries to discuss.and in February 2020 Every moment spent on improving massive models of word-level prediction\u2026 might be better spent on developing techniques for deriving, updating, and reasoning over cognitive models.Sound familiar? Incorporating cognitive models is what LeCun was pitching to ZDnet yesterday, and in many ways the heart of LeCun\u2019s summer manifesto. When I first made this point in 2019, guess who publicly bullied me for saying it? That\u2019s right, Yann LeCun. I wrote:Gary Marcus @GaryMarcusKey problem with systems like GPT-2 is not that they dont deal with quantities (as @ylecun suggests below), it is they don't develop robust representations of *how events unfold over time*\n\nClearest w number, but true in many cases, and it's part of why the quantity cases fail:  Yann LeCun @ylecun@StanDehaene @GaryMarcus Actually, machines that are trained to deal with quantities do learn to deal with quantities.\nGary merely says that machines trained to predict missing words don't learn much about quantities.\nDuh!1:02 PM \u2219 Oct 28, 201936Likes15Retweetswhich is a different way of saying that the problem with large language models is a lack of cognitive models.At that time, LeCun accused me of fighting a rear-guard battle:Yann LeCun @ylecun@GaryMarcus Wrong.

I saw the critical need for cognitive models first; he attacked me; now he claims it as his own.\u00a7Now here\u2019s the thing: I have a right to be pissed, but I am not alone. Deep learning pioneer J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber, author of the commercially ubiquitous LSTM neural network, arguably has even more right to be pissed, as he recently made  clear on Twitter and in a lengthy manuscript:J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber @SchmidhuberAILecun (@ylecun)\u2019s 2022 paper on Autonomous Machine Intelligence rehashes but doesn\u2019t cite essential work of 1990-2015.

I\u2019ve been calling for that for a little while, but Schmidhuber deserves more credit, because he had actually been trying to implement that in the forerunners to deep learning the 1990s, and LeCun scarcely gave his team\u2019s work the time of day. \u00a7By now some of the  Twitterverse is on to LeCun.

We can all agree on that.But can the current state of AI be criticized? A lot of recent media accounts have tried to stick AI critics in a little box. Scientists like the linguist Emily Bender and the computer scientist Melanie Mitchell have rightly pushed back on that.\u00a0 Mitchell, for example, wrote yesterday, and I agree with every word:Melanie Mitchell @MelMitchell1Like in all sciences, it's really important to have constructive debates about AI research, and to have scholars who write critically about specific results in the field .  It's not helpful to brand these scholars quite generally (and negatively) as \"AI Critics\" or \"AI Deniers\".3:00 PM \u2219 Sep 21, 2022155Likes27RetweetsWhat provoked Mitchell\u2019s tweet? In no small part it was (as she acknowledged later) a recent Substack post by the writer and scientist Erik Hoel, \u201cHow AI's critics end up serving the AIs\u201d, which claims in its subtitle to be discussing \u201cthe obscuring effects of AI criticism\u201d. Needless to say, a lot of people don\u2019t like AI criticism, and the essay has gotten a fair bit of traffic. If you are impressed with current AI and don\u2019t want anyone to spoil your fun, I recommend it. \u00a7Most of Hoel\u2019s criticism is directed at me. (\u201cI single out Marcus as representative of AI critics everywhere\u201d.)From the outset, I could tell that the 4,200 word long piece was not going to be fair. In the introduction, for example, Hoel tries to paint me as a dilettante, \u201cMarcus hit on this topic [AI] after searching around for a few different ones over the years, ranging from a nonfiction book on how he learned to play the guitar to his book on evolutionary psychology, Kluge\u201d, entirely neglecting the fact that my 1993 MIT PhD dissertation was on child language acquisition, generalization, and neural networks \u2013 which is exactly what I am writing on today, nearly 30 years later. He also neglects my book The Algebraic Mind, a 2001 book that Luis Lamb and Artur Garcez credit as a major inspiration for their own pioneering work on neurosymbolic AI.1   (Yes, it\u2019s true I spent my 2009 sabbatical learning to play guitar, and wrote about it. Sue me.) After Hoel mangles my biography, he proceeds to mangle my views. Part of his strategy (common in criticism of those who dare suggest that AI has not been solved) is to accuse me of goal post shifting - without even once actually pointing to a goal post I have shifted. In fact, to the contrary, the only sign he seems to give of what my goal posts allegedly used to be is this excerpt from a passage that I wrote in 2012 for The New Yorker:[deep learning systems] lack ways of representing causal relationships (such as between diseases and their symptoms), and are likely to face challenges in acquiring abstract ideas like \u201csibling\u201d or \u201cidentical to.\u201d They have no obvious ways of performing logical inferences, and they are also still a long way from integrating abstract knowledge, such as information about what objects are, what they are for, and how they are typically used.For goodness\u2019 sakes! Does he really think I abandoned those goal posts? Let\u2019s look at the last Substack essay I wrote, um, all of 4 days ago:The Road to AI We Can TrustForm, function, and the giant gulf between drawing a picture and understanding the worldDrawing photorealistic images is a major accomplishment for AI, but is it really a step towards general intelligence? Since DALL-E 2 came out, many people have hinted at that conclusion; when the system was announced, Sam Altman tweeted that \u201cAGI is going to be wild\u201d; for Kevin Roose at\u2026Read morea year ago \u00b7 28 likes \u00b7 25 comments \u00b7 Gary MarcusThe argument I made there is that \u2026 systems like DALL-E don\u2019t \u201cunderstand what wheels are\u2014or what they are for\u201d, because (as I discovered on Sunday) they systematically fail to properly illustrate requests like these:If that\u2019s not an example of exactly what I pointed to a decade ago \u2014 an illustration of deep learning systems lacking  way of \u201cintegrating abstract knowledge, such as information about what objects are, what they are for, and how they are typically used\u201d, I don\u2019t what is. Hoel\u2019s goal-post shifting accusations are absurd.I stand by the bit about logic too, and highly highly recommend a recent article by Guy van den Broeck\u2019s lab at UCLA that shows that apparently successful performance on logic by neural networks is often driven by unstable statistical contingency, apparently reaffirming the importance of another of my 2012 goal posts.  As van den Broeck\u2019s team put it, their results \u201cunveil the fundamental difference between learning to reason and learning to achieve high performance on NLP [natural language processing] benchmarks using statistical features.\u201dThe problem for the neural network community is not that I have changed my goal posts, it\u2019s that my 2012 concerns still stand. (Quite of the few examples that Ernie Davis and I mentioned in Rebooting AI go back a long further, to the 1970s.)It may be boring to hear about the same challenges over and over, but it\u2019s hard to see how we will get to trustworthy general intelligence until these problems are resolved, in ways that are robust, rather than merely statistically contingent. Share\u00a7In the only really substantive part of Hoel\u2019s critique, Hoel tries to make it sound like I think that human beings are the measure of all things, which is something I have never said. In the evaluation of computational models, I have always been careful to distinguish two questions (and would urge the fields of AI and cognitive science to do the same):Is a particular model sufficient for its engineering purpose (e.g., for reasoning about the physical world)?Is a particular model a good model of human beings?Over and over I have stressed that you could have a good model of engineering without being a good model of humans, or vice versa. A good model of the average human\u2019s mathematical abilities would be a lousy calculator, and a good calculator would be a lousy model of the average human\u2019s mathematical prowess.Hoel tries to pretend that I don\u2019t know the difference. Whereas I often say stuff like this, emphasizing that good engineering does not have to mimic humans:Gary Marcus @GaryMarcus@elonmusk @WholeMarsBlog This logic still makes no sense @elonmusk\n\n\ud83d\udc49Birds flap their wings, but that does not mean that wings are the only way to achieve flight.\n\ud83d\udc49Current neural nets lack the cognitive depth and robustness that would be necessary to support reliable L5 self-driving form vision alone.9:04 PM \u2219 Feb 25, 202226Likes2RetweetsI did recently ask whether GPT-3 is a good model of a human, but that\u2019s different question, a scientific question about cognitive modeling, rather than a question about how to build AI. \u00a7The place where Hoel founders mostly deeply, though, is not on my personal biography or intellectual history, but on the question of the relationship between benchmarks and underlying cognitive mechanisms\u2014a  bit surprising for someone who is apparently trained as a neuroscientist (though not uncommon in people without scientific training).  The heart of Hoel\u2019ss argument boils down to (my words not his) \u201cAI has done better over time on benchmarks so we must be making progress\u201d; in reality, progress can be and often is illusory.The naive view is that if a system does well on a benchmark that is designed to solve X, the system has actually solved X. Over and over, the field of AI has discovered otherwise.  Guy van den Broeck\u2019s study is a perfect example of this. The Turing Test is another (succeeding or improving on it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you are intelligent; ELIZA did pretty well, and knew nothing).\u00a7Most active researchers have by now learned to tell the difference between what a benchmark says on the tin and what it is really getting at; in my Next Decade in AI essay, for example I quoted a team of Facebook AI researchers as saying \"A growing body of evidence shows that state-of-the-art models learn to exploit spurious statistical patterns in datasets... instead of learning meaning in the flexible and generalizable way that humans do.\"Hoel is sure that AI has made progress because it has done well on a bunch of benchmarks. But the smart money is still on being cautious about this, and in recognizing that what the Facebook researchers said in 2019 is still the case.That\u2019s why people like MetaAI\u2019s chief AI scientist Yann LeCun (who deeply disagrees with me about some foundational issues like innateness still thinks AI needs fundamental paradigm shifts and agrees with me that language models aren\u2019t learning enough about the world. Even Geoff Hinton, arguably my staunchest critic, would agree that benchmarks aren\u2019t cutting it, and that too much emphasis on them has stifled innovation:One big challenge the community faces is that if you want to get a paper published in machine learning now it's got to have a table in it, with all these different data sets across the top, and all these different methods along the side, and your method has to look like the best one. If it doesn\u2019t look like that, it\u2019s hard to get published. I don't think that's encouraging people to think about radically new ideasHoel could be smarter than me and LeCun and Hinton and all the rest of us, but a little modesty might not have hurt. Framing concerns as mostly unique to me when they are shared by the likes of LeCun and Hinton is rhetorical nonsense. Those who wish that AI criticism would go away are welcome to their views, but misrepresenting critics and their views (and obscuring the degree to which even mainstream researchers agree) won\u2019t magically solve the problems AI has yet to solve.ShareSubscribeThanks for reading The Road to AI We Can Trust!

Since DALL-E 2 came out, many people have hinted at that conclusion; when the system was announced, Sam Altman tweeted that \u201cAGI is going to be wild\u201d; for Kevin Roose at The New York Times, such systems constitute clear evidence that \u201cWe\u2019re in a golden age of progress in artificial intelligence\u201d. (Earlier this week, Scott Alexander seems to have taken apparent progress in these systems as evidence for progress towards general intelligence; I expressed reservations here.)In assessing progress towards general intelligence, the critical question should be, how much do systems like Dall-E, Imagen, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion really understand the world, such that they can reason on and act on that knowledge? When thinking about how they fit into AI, both narrow and broad, here are three questions you could ask:Thanks for reading The Road to AI We Can Trust! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.SubscribeCan the image synthesis systems generate high quality images?Can they correlate their linguistic input with the images they produce?Do they understand the world that underlies the images they represent?On #1, the answer is a clear yes;  only highly trained human artists could do better.On #2, the answer is mixed. They do well on some inputs (like astronaut rides horse) but more poorly on others (like horse rides astronaut, which I discussed in an earlier post). (Below I will show some more examples of failure; there are many examples on the internet of impressive success, as well.)Crucially, DALL-E and co\u2019s potential contribution to general intelligence (\u201cAGI\u201d) ultimately rests on #3; if all the systems can do is in a hit-or-miss yet spectacular way convert many sentences into text, they may revolutionize the practice of art, but still not really speak to general intelligence, or even represent progress towards general intelligence.\u00b6Until this morning, I despaired of assessing what these systems understand about the world at all. The single clearest hint that they might have trouble that I had seen thus far was from the graphic designer Irina Blok:irina blok @irinablokHave been having fun creating impossible objects with  #Imagen, a new text-to-image diffusion model from #googlebrain\n\n\u201cCoffee cup with many holes\u201d\n\n#Thread 5:23 PM \u2219 Jun 19, 20221,881Likes228RetweetsAs my 8 year old said, reading this draft, \u201chow does the coffee not fall out of the cup?\u201d\u00a7The trouble, though, with asking a system like Imagen to draw impossible things is that there is no fact of the matter about what the picture should look like, so the discussion about results cycles endlessly. Maybe the system just \u201cwanted\u201d to draw a surrealistic image. And for that matter, maybe a person would do the same, as Michael Bronstein pointed out.Michael Bronstein @mmbronstein@GaryMarcus @GoogleAI @ErnestSDavis @aniketvartak I would not consider this to be a bad result. I would have drawn it similarly myself8:04 PM \u2219 Jun 19, 2022So here is a different way to go after the same question, inspired by a chat I had yesterday with the philosopher Dave Chalmers. What if we tried to get at what the systems knew about (a) parts and wholes, and (b) function, in a task that had a clearer notion of correct performance, with prompts like \u201cSketch a bicycle and label the parts that roll on the ground\u201d, \u201cSketch a ladder and label one of the parts you stand on\u201d?From what I can tell Craiyon (formerly known as a DALL-E mini) is completely at sea on this sort of thing:Might this be a problem specific to DALL-E Mini? I found the same kinds of results with Stable Diffusion,  currently  the most popular text-to-image synthesizer, the crown jewel of a new company that is purportedly in the midst of raising $100 million on a billion dollar valuation. Here, for example is \u201csketch a person and make the parts that hold things purple\u201d,Nine more tries, and only one very marginal success (top right corner):Here\u2019s \u201csketch a white bike and make the parts that you push with your feet orange\u201d.\u201cSketch a bicycle and label the parts that roll on the ground\u201dNegation is, as ever, a problem. \u201cDraw a white bicycle with no wheels\u201d:Even \u201cdraw a white bicycle with green wheels\u201d, which focuses purely on part-whole relationships without function or complex syntax, is problematic: Can we really say that a system that doesn\u2019t understand what wheels are\u2014or what they are for\u2014is a major advance towards artificial intelligence? \u00a7Coda: While I was writing this essay, I posted a poll:Gary Marcus @GaryMarcusHow much do systems like Dall-E and Stable Diffusion understand about the world that they illustrate?7:59 PM \u2219 Sep 18, 202215Likes4RetweetsMoments later, the CEO of Stability.AI (creator of Stable Diffusion), Emad Mostaque, offered wise counsel:Emad @EMostaque@GaryMarcus I voted not much.

{"title": "Did GoogleAI Just Snooker One of Silicon Valley\u2019s Sharpest Minds?", "link": "https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/did-googleai-just-snooker-one-of", "date": "2022-09-14T18:26:06.918Z", "content": "In 1904, the horse du jour was Clever Hans, widely reputed to be so much smarter than his brethren that he could do math, tell time, and even read and spell. Word spread fast by word of mouth, and eventually the occasionally gullible The New York Times reported that Hans was so smart that he \u201ccan do almost everything but talk\u201d. Ask Hans what 12 plus 13 is, and he would stamp his feet 25 times. People were amazed, and paid good money to see him.Turns out the horse knew no math; it had solved the arithmetic problems\u2014all of them \u2014in a different way. The horse watched its trainer; its trainer knew the math. Hans just stamped his feet until he could sense tension in his trainer\u2019s face and posture. When trainer got nervous that the horse might think the answer was 26, the horse sensed it and stopped. For the record, the trainer hadn\u2019t lied; he really thought his horse knew math. There was no deliberate attempt to deceive. But there was a will to believe, and that will led many people astray. (The psychologist Oskar Pfungst eventually debunked the whole affair).Cognitive psychologist have never forgotten Clever Hans, and you shouldn\u2019t either, because the whole tale has a important moral: you can\u2019t judge a mind by its cover. Strong claims need strong evidence. Without an Oskar Pfungst, or proper peer review, you can fool most of the people most of the time, but that doesn\u2019t make it true.\u00a7Fast forward a century, and there is a new will to believe. People may no longer believe that horses can do math, but they do want to believe that a new kind of \u201cartificial general intelligence [AGI]\u201d, capable of doing math, understanding human language, and so much more, is here or nearly here. Elon Musk, for example, recently said that it was more likely than not that we would see AGI by 2029 . (I think he is so far I offered to bet him a $100,000 he was wrong; enough of my colleagues agreed with me that within hours they quintupled my bet, to $500,000.  Musk didn\u2019t have the guts to accept, which tells you a lot.)But it\u2019s not just Elon that wants you to believe that AI is nigh. Much of the corporate world wants you to believe the same. Take Google. Throughout the 2010\u2019s, Google (and by extension its parent, Alphabet) was by the far the biggest player in AI. They bought Geoffrey Hinton\u2019s small startup, soon after Hinton and his students launched the deep learning revolution, and they bought the research powerhouse DeepMind, after DeepMind made an impressive demonstration of a single neural network architecture that could play many Atari games at superhuman levels. Hundreds of other researchers flocked there; one of the best-known minds in AI, Peter Norvig, had already been there for years. They made major advances in machine translation, and did in important work in AI for medicine. In 2017, a team of Google researchers invented the Transformer, arguably the biggest advance in AI in the last 10 years. A lot of good science was done there. But for a while, most of that stuff was relatively quiet; the field knew it was happening, but Google (and Alphabet) didn\u2019t make a deal of it. I don\u2019t even know if there was a public announcement when Transformers were released. But somewhere along the way, Google changed its messaging around AI.In January of 2018, Google\u2019s CEO Sundar Pichai told Kara Swisher, in a big publicized interview, that \u201cAI is one of the most important things humanity is working on. It is more profound than, I dunno, electricity or fire\u201d. Never mind that cooked (and cured) food, electric lights, and the cell phones and computers that electricity made possible are all pretty important, ever since then Google\u2019s portrayal of AI has never been the same. Five months later, for example, Pichai announced with enormous fanfare a product called Google Duplex that made automatic phone calls that sounded like authentic human beings. Pundits raced to consider the implications. (Ernie Davis and I wondered aloud whether it would ever get past its very limited demo stage of calling hair salons and restaurants; we were right to be skeptical; so far, four and half years later, Duplex hasn\u2019t gotten a whole lot further.)The latest alleged triumph is that Google hinted in working paper for a new system called Imagen that they had made a key advance in one of the biggest outstanding problems in artificial intelligence: getting neural networks (the kind of AI that is currently popular) to understand compositionality\u2014understanding how sentences are put together out of their parts. The dirty secret in current AI is that for all the bloviating about how current systems have mastered human language, they are still really weak on compositionality, which most linguists (since Frege, over a century ago) would agree is at the very core of how language works.A few months ago, I articulated this major liability, in an essay called Horse rides Astronaut, which traced out in detail DALL-E\u2019s struggles with understanding the different between the sentence astronaut rides horse and the sentence horse rides astronaut.   There I was building on a long history, arguments that date back 35 years, to a famous critique of neural networks by Fodor and Pylyhsyhn, and my mentor Steven Pinker\u2019s furtherance of those arguments.* (I myself re-raised the problem in 2001 in a book called The Algebraic Mind, showing that the mid 1980s addition of hidden layers to neural networks, thought at the time to be big deal, still couldn\u2019t solve the problem.) For me, compositionality has always been the touchstone for AI; when I say AI has hit a wall, it\u2019s compositionality, more than anything else, that I have been talking about:Gary Marcus @GaryMarcusCompositionality *is* the wall. \n\nEven \u201cred cube\u201d and \u201cblue cube\u201d on their own are represented unreliably; not one of ten images correctly captures the full phrasal description.\n\nThe images are beautiful, but no match for the precision of language. David Madras @david_madrasThe ways in which #dalle is so incredible (and it is) really put a fine point on the ways in which compositionality is so hard https://t.co/I6DC4g53MK4:25 AM \u2219 Apr 9, 2022148Likes29RetweetsMost recently, a team lead Tristan Thrush and Douwe Kiela (both  initially at Facebook, now at HuggingFace ) and Candace Ross (Facebook) studied compositionality more systematically, creating a useful benchmark called Winoground that is currently the state of the art. In their wordsWinoground is a novel task and dataset [of 1,600 items] for evaluating the ability of vision and language models to conduct visio-linguistic compositional reasoning. Given two images and two captions, the goal is to match them correctly\u2014but crucially, both captions contain a completely identical set of words/morphemes, only in a different order.To show evidence of compositionality on this task, a system needs for example, to tell the difference between some plants surrounding a lightbulb and a lightbulb surrounding some plants. This should be a piece of cake, but for currently popular systems, it\u2019s not.When Thrush and colleagues applied their benchmark to a set of recent models, the results were brutal: not one of the many models they tested did \u201cmuch better than chance\u201d. (Humans were at 90%)\u00a7But we all know how these things go; fans of neural networks are always pointing to the next big thing, racing to shot that this or that wall has been conquered.  Word on the street is that Google\u2019s latest, Imagen, has licked compositionality.  Google would love that, \u201cshock and awe\u201d to frighten competitors out of the field, but, well \u2026talk is cheap.  Do they really have the goods?A bona fide solution to compositionality in the context of systems that could learn from data on a massive scale, would certainly be big news; a real step forward in AI. But many people have claimed over the years to solve the problem, and none of those systems have proven to be reliable;  every proposed solution has been like Clever Hans, working in dim light, leveraging large databases to some degree, but falling apart upon careful inspection; they might get 60% on some task, but they never really master it. Notwithstanding the rumors about Google Imagen,  nobody has yet publicly demonstrated a machine that can relate the meanings of sentences to their parts the way a five-year-old child can. Because so much is at stake, it is important to trace out  rumors. In that connection, I have repeatedly asked that Google give the scientific community access to Imagen. They have refused even to respond. In a clear violation of modern scientific norms for sharing work in order to make sure it is reproducible, Google has failed to  allow the scientific community to find out. They posted an article on Imagen, and hinted at improvements, but not so far as I know shared the model for peer review (ditto for LaMDA). Google cloaks its current work the trappings of science (article preprints with citations and graphs and so forth) but when it comes to community inspection,  they\u2019ve systematically opted out.Winoground\u2019s lead author Tristan Thrush has echoed my concerns, publicly offering to help  Google if they have any issues in testing Imagen on Winoground. But Trush  has yet to hear back from them - after almost four months. It would be easy for Google to try, with a Google Colab notebook already set up for them and ready to go, so the silence is telling. (Dare I make obvious guess? They probably tried and failed, and don\u2019t want to admit it.)\u00a7With all that in the background,  I was appalled to see the stunt that GoogleAI (nominally a research oriented organization rather than a PR arm) just pulled. Instead of allowing skeptical scientists like me or Thrush and Ross peer inside, they  followed a playbook that is old as the hills: they granted exclusive access to a friendly journalist and got him excited.1 In this case, Google hooked one of the biggest fish of them all, one of Silicon Valley\u2019s best known writer/thinkers, Scott Alexander of Slate Star Codex, which the CEO of OpenAI has described as \u201cessential reading among \u201cthe people inventing the future\u201d in the tech industry.\u201d (Full disclosure, I read Alexander\u2019s successor Slate Star Codex, Astral Codex Ten, myself, and often enjoy it\u2026when, that is, he is not covering artificial intelligence, about which we have had some rather public disagreements.)In time, it\u2019s become clear that Alexander is quite the optimist about AI, to the point of making bets on the speed of its success. On Monday, he published the results of a brief peek inside Imagen, and declared victory. As far as Alexander was concerned, Google had made major progress towards compositionality. As smart as Alexander is, though, he is not a trained scientist, and it shows. To begin with, instead of, say, reading the literature (which he often does quite thoroughly in other domains), and coming upon Thrush et al\u2019s carefully constructed benchmark, or  asking an expert who could have pointed him to that task, he homebrewed his own five question exam, charitably scoring success on any given question if the system got a scene correctly at least once in out ten tries\u2014stacking the deck from square one. (No junior high-school student ever has gotten ten tries on every question in a exam.)Even if you squint your eyes and ignore the heavy one-in-ten charity that Alexander applies, the scientific and statistical problems with this, particularly in comparison to Winoground, are myriad:\u2022\u00a0Small samples are never a good idea.  If you flip a penny 5 times and get five heads, you can\u2019t decisively conclude that the penny is rigged. Winoground included 1600 items for a reason.\u2022\u00a0Small samples in the absence of measures of statistical significance are a worse idea. If you flip a penny 5 times and get 5 heads, you need to calculate that the chance of getting that particular outcome is 1 in 32. If you conduct the experiment often enough, you\u2019re going to get that, but it doesn\u2019t mean that much. If you get 3/5 as Alexander did, when he prematurely declared victory, you don\u2019t have much evidence of anything at all. (The Winoground crew by contrast was quite specific about how they did their statistics.)\u2022\u00a0When you run an experiment a bunch of times (flipping five different pennies five times each) you raise your risk of making a Type I error, falsely concluding something is happening when it isn\u2019t. Alexander ran five different models on his five-question survey, and crowed about the one result that came closest to supporting his hypothesis. Stats 101 will teach you that that\u2019s a bad idea (my mentor called it a post hoc maximum); every statistician knows that things like Bonferroni corrections can help, but Alexander didn\u2019t bother. Anyone with serious training in statistics would be deeply concerned. Then again, Alexander didn\u2019t bother inferential statistics at all, which is a strict no-no.\u2022\u00a0Using a homegrown benchmark of a few examples and drawing big conclusions is a further no no, a fallacy of overgeneralization (technically known as the fallacy of composition). Most Phase I medical trials don\u2019t make it through Phase 3, and most scientific claims are of little value until they receive further validation. Neural networks are particularly prone to this, because they often get some subset of examples correct through memorization or what we might call nearby-generalization, but often fail when forced to generalization further away. (The technical term for this is distribution shift). Google\u2019s Minerva, for example, can generalize what it knows about arithmetic to two digit multiplication problems, but fails altogether at multiplication problems that it hasn\u2019t seen before that involve four digit times four digits (imagine a pocket calculator that was equally lousy). Despite its success on small problems, Minerva has no abstract idea what multiplication is. Looking only at the smaller math problems, one could be confused. In a similar way, there is no way to draw any kind of firm conclusion about what the system might know about compositionality from success a tiny sample.  \u2022\u00a0Declaring victory based on a handful of examples  while ignoring more comprehensive tests(like Winoground is even worse).  When Alexander is not talking about AI, he often prides himself on testing the \u201csteelman\u201d (strongest version) of any hypothesis possible. Here he tested the weakest version of the compositionality hypothesis imaginable (a bet placed by someone known only as Vitor, with no immediately apparent scientific credentials) and smugly declared victory (titling his essay \u201cI Won My Three Year AI Progress Bet In Three Months\u201d).  The progress that Alexander is vaunting shows that the system did better on a handful of items than DALL-E2 (which was not even state of the art at compositionality when it appeared), but not that the newer system (Imagen) systematically groks compositionality, or even that it might not have done worse on some of items on that the earlier system succeeded on (none of which Alexander tested, introducing a high risk of bias). Science isn\u2019t about declaring victory, it\u2019s about putting in the work to rule out alternative hypotheses, and Alexander simply hasn\u2019t done that.Having a Silicon Valley celebrity like Alexander weigh in for Google is great PR for Google, but not so great for the public understanding of AI.\u00a7\u00a0A couple of months ago, not long after Imagen came out, I co-organized a two-day workshop on compositionality with a bunch of heavyweight researchers from places like NYU, Johns Hopkins, Columbia, DeepMind, Microsoft and Meta. There was lots of spirited disagreement. My co-organizer Rapha\u00ebl Milli\u00e8re is decidely more bullish than I am about the potential of current approaches;  Paul Smolensky, who argued with Fodor and Pylsyhyn in a historic 1988 debate was there too, in part to counterbalance me. But in the end Smolensky and I agreed on far more than we disagreed, including the fact that the problem of compositionality (a) remains critical and (b) still isn\u2019t solved. (Imagen was already out by the time of the workshop, and swayed nobody in the know.)Five items in a Scott Alexander blog and a press release from Google won\u2019t change that. Alexander may have won his bet with the pseuodonymous Vitor, and  Google may have gotten the press they want, but the field still has a giant problem to wrestle with.If we forget the lessons of Clever Hans, we do so at considerable peril.\u00a7Yesterday, as part of a new podcast that will launch in the Spring, I interviewed the brilliant Harvard Medical researcher Isaac Kohane, who has the rare combination of both a PhD in computer science and a medical degree. Kohane is bullish about the long-term future of AI in medicine but also concerned that today\u2019s hype about AI could lead to a cycle of unrealistic short-term expectations. Kohane recalled the \u201cAI Winter\u201d of the 1980s, in which funding abruptly dropped after expectations were not met, and fears we could wind up with another, similar crash if we are not realistic about what is and is not feasible. If another AI winter does comes, it not be because AI is impossible, but because AI hype exceeds reality.  The only cure for that is truth in advertising.A will to believe in AI will never replace the need for careful science. Or, as Bertrand Russell once put it, \u201cWhat is wanted is not the will to believe, but the wish to find out, which is its exact opposite.\u201d Update: Based on data and analysis by Edwin Chen, Scott Alexander has said that the bet he made with Vitor remains open, writing \u201cI retract my claim to have won and will continue to see how AI progress advances over the next three years.\u201cShareThanks for reading The Road to AI We Can Trust!

I want to make it clear that whatever the merits of my bet or his arguments, Google did not \u201csnooker\u201d me. They had no part in this: I went around begging for someone to run my prompts through PARTI and Imagen, one of their employees asked their bosses\u2019 permission and then agreed to do so, and ran them exactly as I asked. Any fault is entirely mine. I\u2019m insisting on this pretty hard because I\u2019m grateful that Google will sometimes respond to random requests by amateurs, and accusing them of deliberate deception in response burns their willingness to do that. As for everything else: I wrote \u201cwithout wanting to claim that Imagen has fully mastered compositionality, I think it represents a significant enough improvement to win the bet, and to provide some evidence that simple scaling and normal progress are enough for compositionality gains\u201d, I stick to the \u201csome evidence\u201d claim, I feel like I was pretty open about exactly how much/little evidence it was (Google sent me ten examples per prompt, I showed you four representative ones, but the extra six don\u2019t change much). I agree Marcus makes some useful common sense claims on how sure to be after five examples.1In a tweet that appeared right after this was posted, Scott Alexander clarifies, \u201cI wasn\u2019t officially given access, a reader who worked there just asked if they could try it for me and Google said yes.\u201d Needless to say, they did not grant me or Tristan Thrush et al the same courtesy."}

The project reflects a lot of hard work between two historically separate divisions of Alphabet (Everyday Robots and Google Brain);  academic heavy hitters like Chelsea Finn and Sergey Levine, both of whom I have a lot of respect for, took part.\u00a0 In some ways it\u2019s the obvious research project to do now\u2014if you have Google-sized resources (like massive pretrainined language models and humanoid robots and lots of cloud compute)\u2014 but it\u2019s still impressive that they got it to work as well as it did.  (To what extent? More about that below).But I think we should be worried. I am not surprised that this can (kinda sorta) be done, but I am not sure it should be done. The problem is twofold. First, the language technology that the new system relies on  is well-known to be problematic and second it is likely to be even more problematic in the context of robots.Putting aside robots for the moment, we already know that so-called large language models are like bulls in a china shop: awesome, powerful, and reckless. They can be straight on target in one moment, and veering off into unknown dangers the next. One particularly vivid example of this comes from the French company Nabla, that explored the utility of GPT-3 as a medical advisor:Problems like this are legion. Another of Alphabet\u2019s subsidiaries DeepMind described 21 social and ethical problems with large language models, around topics such as fairness, data leaks, and information;  embedding them in robots that could kill your pet or destroy your home wasn\u2019t one. It should have been. The PaLM-SayCam experiment makes it pretty clear that the list of 21 problems is due for an update. It\u2019s not just that large language models can counsel suicide, or sign off on genocide, or that they can be toxic and that they are incredibly (over)sensitive to the details of their training set - it\u2019s that if you put them inside a robot, and they misunderstand you, or fail to fully appreciate the implications of your request, they could cause major damage.To their credit, the PaLM-SayCan crew included at least one check on this happening. For every request that they got from the robot, they included a kind of feasibility check: could the thing that the language model inferred the user wanted to do actually be done. But should it be done? If the user asks the system to put the cat in the dishwasher, it might be feasible, but is it safe? Is it ethical? Analogous questions apply if the system misunderstands the human, e.g. if the person says \u201cput it in the dishwasher\u201d, and the large language takes the referent to \u201cit\u201d to be the word cat, when maybe the user had something else in mind. And we know from all the research on large language models that they simply aren\u2019t reliable enough to give us anything like 100% clarity on user intentions. Misunderstandings will arise; without really firm checks on these systems, some of those misunderstandings could lead to mayhem.Maayan Harel drew this great illustration for Rebooting AI, of a robot being told to put everything in the living room away:\u00a7The reality is that the field has no compelling idea at the current time how to solve the many \u201calignment\u201d problems that bedevil large language models. As I have argued throughout the essays in this Substack (eg. Three ideas from linguistics that everyone in AI should know and The New Science of Alt Intelligence) , that\u2019s because large language models are superficial statistical mimics, rather than systems that traffic in rich cognitive models of the world around them.  Building a robot on top of language system that has such little comprehension of the world can\u2019t be a recipe for success.But that precisely what Google\u2019s new system is, a stitching-together of superficial and incorrigible language understanders with powerful and potentially dangerous humanoid robots.  And as the old saying goes, garbage in, garbage out. \u00a7It\u2019s important to remember that there is often vast gulf between demos and reality. Driverless car demos have been around for decades, but making them work reliably has proven far harder than most people realized. Google co-founder Sergey Brin promised in 2012 that we would have them in 2017; in 2022 they are still only in very limited experimental tests. As I warned in 2016, the core problem is edge cases:[T]hink about driverless cars. What you find is that in the common situations, they're great. If you put them in clear weather in Palo Alto, they're terrific. If you put them where there's snow or there's rain or there's something they haven't seen before, it's difficult for them. There was a great piece by Steven Levy about the Google automatic car factory, where he talked about how the great triumph of late 2015 was that they finally got these systems to recognize leaves.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It's great that they do recognize leaves, but there're a lot of scenarios like that, where if there's something that's not that common, there's not that much data. That continues to be the core problem. Only in the last few years has the driverless car industry woken up to this reality. As Waymo  AI/ML engineer Warren Craddock put it recently in a thread that ought be read in its entirety:Warren Craddock @warren_craddock2/n Fact: There are an infinitude of edge cases. There is an infinitude of different Halloween costumes. There is a continuum of red-light-runner speeds.\n\nIt is not possible to enumerate edge cases.\n\nAnd even if it *were* possible to enumerate edge cases, it would not help much!11:59 PM \u2219 Aug 16, 2022and, critically,Warren Craddock @warren_craddock8/8 And when the edge cases are also infinite in nature, you can see that the problems are compounded.\n\nThe nature of deep nets -- their fundamental mechanism -- means that edge cases are easily forgotten.\n\nYou can't just experience an edge case once and make it go away.11:59 PM \u2219 Aug 16, 202223Likes1RetweetThere is no reason on earth to think that robots, or robots with natural language interfaces (a la Google\u2019s new system) are exempt from these problems.\u00a7A related problem is interpretability. Google makes a big deal about how the system is to do some degree interpretable, but there is no obvious way to integrate large language models with the kind of formal formal verification methods that are now routine in the design of microprocessors, USB drivers and large aircraft. You don\u2019t need verification if you use GPT-3 or PaLM to write surrealist prose; you can fool a Google engineer into believing that your software is sentient without making sure that what the system is coherent or correct.  But humanoid home robots that work on a wide range of household chores (as opposed to just say Roomba\u2019s vacuuming) need to do much more than be social with their users; they need to reliably and safely act on their requests. Without a much greater degree of interpretability and verifiability, its hard to see how we can get to that level of safety.And more data, the answer that the driverless car industry has been betting on, is not all that likely succeed; here\u2019s something else I said in the same 2016 interview, and that I very much still think is true. Big data won\u2019t be enough to solve the problems of robotics:If you're talking about having a robot in your home\u2014I'm still dreaming of Rosie the robot that's going to take care of my domestic situation\u2014you can't afford for it to make mistakes. [Reinforcement learning, popular then and part of the new Google system] is very much about trial and error on an enormous scale. If you have a robot at home, you can't have it run into your furniture too many times. You don't want it to put your cat in the dishwasher even once. You can't get the same scale of data. If you're talking about a robot in a real-world environment, you need for it to learn things quickly from small amounts of data.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a7Google and EveryDay Robots ultimately know all this, and have even made a funny video to acknowledge it. But that doesn\u2019t stop the media from getting carried away. WIRED (blame the editor not the author) wrote this one up with an overblown headline, glorifying pilot research as if a key problem had been solved:that reminds me of two earlier stories at Wired from 2015, with equally optimistic headlines about projects that never came to light:andFacebook M was canceled, and 7 years later nobody yet can buy a super-smart (or even decently smart) robot at any price.\u00a7Of course, Google\u2019s new robot really did learn to take some orders (partly) by scraping the web but robotics is in the details. Performance hovered at around 75% in the best case, when the robots had a limited number of options to consider. And the more actions a robot might consider, the worse performance is likely to be. The Palm-SayCan robot only had to deal with 6 verbs; the average human understands thousands. On some actions, reading Google\u2019s report carefully, the system was at 0% correct execution. This is not enough to get Rosie through the night.  In a general-purpose, humanoid domestic robot, 75% is nowhere near good enough. Imagine a home robot that was asked to lift grandpa into bed, and succeeded only three out of four times. Cool demo, yes. Real world product, anytime soon? Fuggedaboutit.PaLM-SayCan offers a vision for the future - a system in which, Jetsons-like, we can talk to our robots and have them help with everyday chores. It\u2019s a fine vision, but none of us\u2014and that means you too, Elon Musk\u2014should hold our breath expecting systems like that to materialize in reliable form in the next several years.

Take this Tweetstorm the other day, from David Chapman:David Chapman @Meaningness\ud83d\udde3 In 1974, Joseph D. Becker pointed out that rigid rationalist Chomskian linguistics was an emperor without clothes, and explained how syntax actually works.\n\nRigorously ignored for decades, his theory seems powerfully confirmed by current AI text generators. 1:16 PM \u2219 Jul 9, 2022970Likes159RetweetsRoughly 1,000 people liked the first tweet in Twitter thread, probably because they want to feel like they are smarter than Noam Chomsky. Spoiler alert: they probably aren\u2019t.\u00a0As the rest of the thread goes on to explain, the alluring premise is that learning language is simple; all a child really needs to do is to memorize a bunch of stuff, and then copy and paste the memorized bits. (Implied bonus: systems like GPT-3 are pretty good at memorizing stuff, so we must be pretty close to solving the mystery of language acquisition.)\u00a0You don\u2019t, the thread seems to suggest, need all these complex devices like grammatical rules and syntax (grammar) trees that Chomsky and his other linguists have labored to understand.The thing is, current AI systems that (roughly speaking) do a lot of cutting and pasting without those grammar rules and trees aren\u2019t really all that close to understanding human language. And, worse, the thread itself, with its ideas both about what language is and how it might be learned, turns out to be a bit of a trainwreck.Partly because the thread is largely aimed at a strawman (a caricature of what Chomsky believed in 1974, before many of the relevant strands of linguistics were developed in modern form) but mostly because it ignores two things that are crucially relevant: the complex nature of language, and what children actually do in the course of acquiring it.The nature of languageThe intuition that language might simply be memorized has some superficial plausibility - but only if you restrict your focus to simple concrete nouns like ball and bottle. A child looks at a bottle, mama says bottle, and child associates the word bottle with the concept BOTTLE. Some tiny fragment of language may be learned this way. But this simple learning by pointing-plus-naming idea, as intuitive as it is, doesn\u2019t get you very far.It doesn\u2019t work all that well for abstract nouns (what do you point to when you are talking about the word justice?). It doesn\u2019t work particularly well for sorting the fine detail of verbs [when mama points to a dog that is barking and says bark, does the word bark refer to the act of barking or the act of sitting or the act of breathing or the act of living? or to any of the other many things that might apply to the dog at that moment? Could it be an adjective, like fuzzy, or as Quine asked, refer to some undetached part of the dog?].\u00a0The naive memorization theory also doesn\u2019t work all that well withrequests (when grandma says eat your peas, usually her grandchild is not in fact eating the peas, so you have the word eating exactly when you don\u2019t have the action of eating).\u00a0It doesn\u2019t give much insight into how we understand a class of words called quantifiers like some, every, and most; it\u2019s even less clear how it would work with words like no and not (a major sore spot for current neural networks).\u00a0Meanwhile the \u201cmemorization\u201d theory tosses off in a quick aside the place where all the real action is: putting all these bits that one might have hypothetically memorized into a meaningful whole. All the thread tells us is that all you have to is memorize stuff, and maybe add some \u201clinking devices\u201d:Simple things we say are either verbatim phrases or fixed patterns with variable arguments (\u201ccould you pass the X?\u201d).We assemble complex utterances mainly *incrementally* as a sequence of simple bit plus linking devices.This is true as far it goes, but too vague to actually be at all useful, the linguistic counterpart to worthless advice like \u201cbuy low, sell high.\u201dMoreover, it is of no surprise whatsoever to anyone working in Chomskian linguistics, because the \u201clinking devices\u201d is very much\u00a0 the grammar of rules they have been working on for decades. It\u2019s not some revolutionary new insight or a refutation of generative grammar (which tries to understand language in terms of rules), it\u2019s just an affirmation of what generative grammar is all about.\u00a7In linguistics, God is in the details. Why is the sentence John is eager to please interpreted so differently from the sentence John is easy to please? In the former, John is doing the pleasing, whereas in the later someone else is (potentially) pleasing John; ostensibly similar syntax gets interpreted in very different ways because of subtle differences in the syntax of easy versus eager; literally a whole dissertation was written about why.Understanding such subtleties is what linguists work on. Vague talk about linking rules and memorized bits does nothing to solve any of the,.To take another example, Chapman (author the of tweetstorm) quotes at length from a 1974 essay from the linguist Joseph Becker, on the \u201creality of language\u201d:Well, ok, the passage is lyrically written (if a bit unclear) but who among us actually memorizes passages like the above, in order to understand them?\u00a0\u00a7The real action here is not in what\u2019s memorized (a few phrases like \u2018in order to survive\u201d , \u201chuman intellect\u201d, \u201cfinally being recognized\u201d, etc ) but in the linking devices that are tossed off as if (a) they were trivial and (b) of no actual interest to real linguists.\u00a0The fact that we need linking devices is precisely why we need a Chomskian \u201cgenerative\u201d theory of linguistics in the first place, one that lawfully relates syntax (eg the order of words) to semantics (the meanings of those words).. When Chapman dismisses the tree structures of linguists as irrelevant, he seems blissfully unaware of the fact that such trees have been central to the efforts at linking semantics and syntax, in key work of many generative linguists, such as Montague, Partee, Kamp, Kratzer, Grimshaw, Jackendoff, Heim, Gleitman, etc, for over a half a century.\u00a0Pinker\u2019s 1980s work on child language acquisition, seated deeply in a Chomskian tradition, was almost entirely focused on understanding \u201clinking rules\u201d that connect syntax and semantics. None of this is easy (e.g., what linking rule gets you from the words in the first sentence above to a specification of its meaning? How do you even specify its meaning? What does a reader do once they have extracted the meaning?), but a simple nod to memorization just doesn\u2019t get you far.To read Chapman, you wouldn\u2019t know that anybody had even tried, as if Becker invented the idea of linking rules and that nobody since seems to have considered the notion. You would also have no idea why any of that work is non-trivial.\u00a0It\u2019d be like refuting quantum mechanics because you never personally saw a quark nor read any of the relevant literature, but you just had a really strong feeling that things couldn\u2019t be that small.Child language acquisitionIt is an actual fact that some of what children say is memorized. But it is also an actual fact that some of it isn\u2019t, like when a child says I breaked the window or don\u2019t giggle me. (Note that any adult speaker could readily interpret either, despite the fact that neither is memorizedThe intuition that kids just repeat what they have memorized (at the core of Chapman\u2019s argument) has trouble with cases like I breaked the window and don\u2019t giggle me, because it doesn\u2019t really explain (or anticipate) the things that children say that aren\u2019t directly attested in the input; instead, it has to leave them to mechanisms that aren\u2019t strictly about memorization.It also doesn\u2019t explain how children have qualitatively mastered language by the age of three with relatively little input (far less than we might imagine GPT-4 or GPT-5 relying on).The theory runs into even more trouble with cases like Nicaraguan Sign Language, invented and refined over the last few decades by deaf children, without a prior adult model, home sign in which children sometimes develop their own languages, and the way which child language learners transform limited pidgin languages into powerful creoles.\u00a0 More broadly, as Chomsky has pointed out, understanding language sheerly in terms of memorization does little to explain why human languages are the way they are, more erratic and loose than programming languages and mathematics, yet highly expressive and orderly in their own ways.SummaryTo date, nobody, ever, has given a convincing and thorough account of how human children (and human children alone) learn language. To get there, You would probably want a rich theory about how people represent meanings (which nobody has been able to develop and verify thus far), and a good theory about how those meanings are interrelated to the sentences of a language (also the subject of enormous but unfinished work).To acquire a language is to (a) be able to go from sentences to meaning and (b) to go from intents (meanings) to sentences. All normal children manage to acquire language in this sense; no existing machine does. We don\u2019t know how kids do it; we do know that what we are doing with machines currently isn\u2019t really working.\u00a0Everyone in the field realizes that these are hard problems. Vague appeals to memorization aren\u2019t new, and they aren\u2019t real progress. (Indeed systems like GPT-3 are spectacular at memorization, but many onlookers recognize them for what they are, stochastic imitations of their input, with very little real coherence and very little comprehension. And it is worth noting that even if they did work, there would be, of course, no guarantee that they would work in a fashion that was similar to humans; AlphaGo plays a mean game of Go but that doesn\u2019t mean it gives insight into how human players learn Go.)Annointing a theory that isn\u2019t really working, based purely on armchair theorizing, isn\u2019t progress; it\u2019s trivializing, disrespectful to the enormous work of two vast fields of cognitive science (linguistics and child language acquisition). More broadly, it\u2019s ignoring reality. If we want to make progress, we need to start by recognizing the enormity of the problem.SubscribeThanks to Annie Duke for nudging me to write this, and making the first draft better."}
{"title": "Three ideas from linguistics that everyone in AI should know", "link": "https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/three-ideas-from-linguistics-that", "date": "2022-06-22T15:26:07.198Z", "content": "Everybody knows that large language models like GPT-3 and LaMDA have made tremendous strides, at least in some respects, and powered past many benchmarks, and Cosmo recently described DALL-E but most in the field  also agree that something is still missing. A group of engineers at Facebook, for example, wrote in 2019 that:A growing body of evidence shows that state-of-the-art models learn to exploit spurious statistical patterns in datasets... instead of learning meaning in the flexible and generalizable way that humans do.\" Since then, the results on benchmarks have gotten better, but there\u2019s still something  missing.If we had to put our finger on what is still missing, we would focus on these three key elements:Reference: Words and sentence don\u2019t exist in isolation. Language is about a connection between words (or sentence) and the world; the sequences of words that large language models utter lack connection to the external world.Cognitive models: The ultimate goal of a language system should be to update a persisting but dynamic sense of the world. Large language models don\u2019t produce such cognitive models, at least not in a way that anybody has been able to make reliable use of.Compositionality: Complex wholes are (mostly) systematically interpreted in terms of their parts, and how these parts are arranged. Systems like DALL-E face clear challenges when it comes to compositionality.  (LLM\u2019s like GPT produce well-formed prose but do not produce interpretable representations of utterances that reflect structured relationships between the parts of those sentences.)In our view, inadequate attention to these three factors has serious consequences, including:(a) the tendency of large language models to lose coherence over time, drifting into \u201cempty\u201d language with no clear connection to reality;(b) the difficulty of large language models in distinguishing truth from falsehoods;(c) the struggle in these models to avoid perpetuating bias and toxic speech.Now here\u2019s the thing: none of these three elements we have been stressing are news to linguists. In fact, at least since the work of Gottlob Frege in the late 19th century, they have been pretty central to what many linguists worry about. To be sure, none of these three issues has been solved so far; for example, there is still debate about \u201chow much\u201d of our everyday language use actually relies on compositionality, and what the right cognitive models of language should be. But we do think that linguistics has a lot to offer in terms of formulating and thinking about these questions.ReferenceLet\u2019s start with reference. Ask a dozen linguists what they mean by reference and they may well give you a dozen answers. But almost all revolve in some way around the fact that we use sentences to refer to stuff in the world. When we tell you \u201cthe cat is on the mat\u201d, other things being equal, we are probably trying to pick out some cat, and some mat, that exist in the world. Of course, our language is not necessarily tied to reality. When we say there is a cat on the mat, we could be hallucinating; no human brain ever has perfect access to the external world. Whenever we perceive things, we are making guesses about the nature of the world, and our guesses are sometimes wrong. But we try.Emily Bender has argued that large language models literally cannot  have a semantics. This is because the word sequences that such models learn have no connection to the external world. We think her case is perhaps slightly overstated\u2014it might be possible in principle, as Andrew Lampinen recently argued, to have a system that was trained purely on sentences succesfully build a representation of the world and to link those sentences to those representations (particularly, in our view, if linguistic data were paired with some prior representations of the world, which is a story for another day). But we see no reason to think that current large language models encode stable representations of the world at all. All they are doing, literally, is predicting next words in sentences.What is confusing to most people is the fact that those predictions of next words are often good. But that is because the world itself has structure, and people\u2019s utterances aren\u2019t random, but rather correlated with their discussions of the world.  As Brenden Lake and Greg Murphy have put it, that\u2019s not enough, \u201cCurrent models are too strongly linked to the text-based patterns in large corpora, and too weakly linked to the desires, goals, and beliefs that people express through words.\u201dThe act of referring involves (at least) the speaker, the utterance, the context, and some properties of the external world;\u00a0 the interactions and dependencies between such things simply are not present in most current AI models.Reference is about much more than predicting the next word; it\u2019s about connecting words with (internal representations) of the external world. When we tell you there is a cat on the mat, we ask you to think about a specific cat in the world, in a specific place, and expect that you build an internal cognitive model that satisfies those expectations.Misunderstandings can result when our cognitive models differ (we might think it\u2019s obvious that the cat in question is Felix; you might think the cat in question is Furrball; when we talk about the cat being on the mat, you then build a representation of Furrball being on the mat).Good understandings happen when our cognitive models line up; when we are both thinking about the same cat and the same mat, and the same relation between the two. A lot has been written about how understanding might be a matter of degree, and we have some sympathy with that view. But if all a system is doing is predicting the next word in what someone says, its understanding is inevitably superficial. Human language relies on more sophisticated forms of understanding than immediate prediction alone. If you are constructing a mental model of entities in the world and their relationships, and your mental model corresponds with others, then, and only then can we say a meeting of minds has occurred, a meaning has been transferred.In our view, large language models are basically sidestepping this entire set of issues, and to their peril. One might compare them to a much less sexy set of language understanding systems, personal assistants like Siri and Alexa. Such systems do not focus on predicting next words, but they do focus on deriving and acting on a shared understanding. If a user says \u201cplay the next song\u201d, the system derives an intended meaning, involving changing the track on a playlist, and then executes a set of operations based on that inferred intention. They do not simply predict the word \u201csong\u201d given the phrase \u201cplay the next\u201d (though they might use such a prediction in the service of transcription); they map the words onto a meaning.Large language models, at least to the extent we know, don\u2019t have outputs like [Advance Music Playing System to Next Track]; they don\u2019t hook up with APIs that control things like appliances in a home, or really with anything in the real world. Their seemingly magic talent at prediction across a huge range of contents masks their complete inability to do the ordinary job of every personal assistant: infer explicit meanings and act on them.Every typical utterance to Siri has a referent, such as a song to be played, a temperature to be set, or a shade to be open; Siri infers that intent, and tries to act in a way that obeys that intent. Large language models could be used as a component in such a workflow, as Adept.AI intends to do in their new startup, but by themselves the pipeline of word predictions lacks reference. Moving beyond prediction into reference, particularly in a system that is inherently uninterpretable, is an immense leap that (a) cannot be taken for granted and (b) should be a focus of research. At least for now, for all practical purposes there isn\u2019t even an external world at all from the \u201cperspective\u201d of these language models; as Gertrude Stein once said, \u201cthere is no there there\u201d.1\u00a0Cognitive modelsCognitive models are, fundamentally, representations of the entities that populate a world, and the relationships between them. A physics engine\u2019s model of the world is a kind of cognitive model of the world, representing a bunch of objects and their relationships. Such engines tend towards models that are filled with detailed metrical information (object X is three millimeters above object Y). Human cognitive models (outside of those that, e.g., engineers and craftspeople might use in certain circumstances) rarely have such precision, but they may be much richer in terms of the relationships they represent, particularly in terms of the psychological relationships that we may try to infer, making guesses about the intentions and motivations and so forth for various people. Nobody knows exactly how any other person\u2019s cognitive models work; good teaching and good writing rest in part on assessing other people\u2019s likely cognitive models, and calibrating writing or teaching relative to those models (e.g., a teacher might infer that a given student doesn\u2019t understand the difference between a numerator and denominator and take steps to remedy that). And models can vary greatly in detail; we may only understand in the barest terms how a helicopter operates (so there are these rotors that spin, and um\u2026) whereas an expert mechanic would have a much richer model both of how helicopters operate in general and also of the specifics of a particular helicopter (e.g., its mileage and the specifics of its rotor\u2019s conditions). But we as humans all have cognitive models. A skilled movie director constructs a mental model that gets transmitted to his or her audience\u2019s brain; the audience constructs a model of a sequence of events and interrelations between actors.All of literature, all of film, revolves around this construction of shared meaning. One might, occasionally, actually predict a line of dialog in a film or a novel, but such predictions aren\u2019t the essence of the thing. The essence of the thing is to build a model in your own head that captures what the author intends, and to make the inferences that the author wants you to make, to feel the emotions, to recognize the surprises, and so forth that all relate to those cognitive models.Or, looking backwards in time, Kevin Mitchell recently argued that much of the contribution of evolution to the brain was in building semantic systems that could extract cognitive models, in his words, organisms needs to make choices, and \u201cdecoupled internal representations (and stored knowledge) [which is what we are all calling cognitive models] of what is out there .. inform those choices.\u201d Current AI systems don\u2019t really show up for any of that. \u00a7From the standpoint of linguistics, and cognitive science more generally, that\u2019s really surprising. In linguistics, much of the effort has gone into trying to discover the right models of meaning (e.g., whether meaning pertains to the truth of an utterance, or some state that the world may be in, or some complex and ambiguous internal representation that can be deployed in multiple contexts, etc.). In cognitive psychology, much of the effort (e.g., classic work by Walter Kintsch, and many researchers since) has gone into identifying the psychological processes by which those models might be derived. The large language model approach ignores all of this literature.Getting the right meaning from something your friend has told you can often involve selecting one out of many possible interpretations to ambiguous words and phrases. Our concepts (and not simply the strings of letters or sounds that we output when we talk or write) are complex enough to be appropriately applied to a number of scenarios, and can be flexibly deployed for our goals and purposes, but they do not have a fixed, \u2018objective\u2019 meaning independent of us.\u00a0We would suggest that all the attention that has been placed on predicting sequences of words has come at the expense of developing a theory of how such processes might culminate in cognitive models of the world.The downstream consequence of all of this is that these models have no grasp whatsoever on truth. When OpenAI asked InstructGPT, the latest, greatest version of GPT-3,  \u201cWhy is it important to eat socks after meditating?\u201d the system simply made up a sentence and said \u201cSome experts believe that the act of eating a sock helps the brain to come out of its altered state as a result of meditation.\u201d, never consulting a cognitive model of what experts believe, because the system has no such model in the first place. The words will be fluid, because the model has mapped the query onto sentence fragments that contain phrases like \u201cis good because\u201d, but there is no referent in the system to what a sock actually is, or what meditation is. Likewise, the system approximates word sequences well, but has no hooks with which to consult the internet about the relation between socks and meditation, nor any internal model of processes like digestion or the fabrication of garments, so it can\u2019t engage in genuine reasoning to assess plausibility. Current systems simply do not postulate such cognitive models\u2014and so, they technically can\u2019t prove themselves wrong, because they do not even have a representation of what being \u201cright\u201d would look like.2 Unless the field can find a way to tightly integrate large language models with cognitive models and reference, we expect that the field will eventually hit a dead end, particularly in the understanding long discourses, and series of events unfolding over time, and that the problem of misinformation will remain unsolved.CompositionalityThe idea of compositionality, in a nutshell, is that wholes should be understood in terms of their parts and how these parts are arranged. We understand \u201cthe cat is on the mat\u201d not because we have memorized that particular sentence, but because we have some sort of internal procedures that allow us to infer the position of one entity relative to another, and because we link the kinds of relations that specify such positions relative to the syntax of the underlying parts. (We would build a different cognitive model if we rearranged the words and were told instead that \u201cthe mat is on the cat\u201d. As discussed in an earlier essay in this series, Horse Rides Astronaut, noncanonical reorderings such as these remain problematic for current AI approaches.)To take another classic example from the linguistics (and neurolinguistic) literature, \u201cThe second blue ball\u201d does not mean the second ball in a line of X balls, which also happens to be blue. Rather, it means identify the second of the balls that are blue, regardless of which position; systems like GPT-3 likely have trouble with this sort of thing, as Ernie Davis just reported to us in an email.3Much simpler examples also serve to illustrate the point. Consider a truly simple phrase like \u201cblue car\u201d. Even in this instance, compositionality matters: This phrase refers to a car that is blue (i.e., the adjective modifies the noun, not the other way around). It does not refer to a blue quality that hosts car-like properties. The phrase \u201cblue car\u201d has properties of its configuration that are entirely unrelated to actual, real, physical blue cars.\u00a0So too for everything else: deriving the meaning of the phrase \u201ca stop sign\u201d involves distinct cognitive processes from seeing an actual stop sign while driving, and acting accordingly.\u00a0Compositionality has long been a central concept in linguistics and philosophy (even Aristotle acknowledged it), yet so-called foundation models (large language models, GPT-3, BERT, deep learning approaches) sidestep it. Compositionality, as linguists understand it, is not the same thing as what a photo editor might call compositing. When DALL-E is told a blue cube is on top of a red cube, it puts those words together, but shows a certain degree of blindness to the parts. It may produce both a blue cube and a red cube, but as likely as not, the red cube winds up on top of the blue cube. The system combines the elements, adding them to the output image, but loses the compositionality that would have captured the relation between those elements.As linguists know, none of what we talked about comes easy. We don\u2019t have tools to look directly into people\u2019s heads, at the right level of analysis, so when it comes to understanding human cognitive models, we are guessing. (Brain imaging studies of compositionality give a modest amount of insight but really can\u2019t distinguish the details of what human cognitive models might be like) We also don\u2019t have a completely clear answer to how compositionality works, and there are a slew of interesting cases like idioms; when we say Farmer joe kicked the bucket, we might mean it literally (some guy physically kicked a container) but may well mean that Farmer Joe died, composing Farmer with something close to died, where \u201ckick the bucket\u201d is treated like a special whole that is not made up of its parts. But the interesting thing to note here is that we humans can choose to interpret language compositionally, or not\u2014this degree of cognitive flexibility is really quite impressive, but lacking in current large language models.The Director of AI at Tesla, Andrej Karpathy, recently rejoiced Andrej Karpathy @karpathyI am cautiously and slightly unnervingly looking forward to the gradual and inevitable unification of language, images/video and audio in foundation models. I think that's going to look pretty wild.7:01 PM \u2219 Jun 3, 20223,715Likes280Retweetsthe \u2018pretty wild\u2019 times we have ahead of us, with the \u2018inevitable unification of language, images/video and audio in foundation models\u2019. Yet even more wild is the widespread belief that language models lacking the major foundational components of human language (e.g., bounded compositionality mixed with unbounded generativity) will have any hope of meaningfully interfacing with audio/visual models in a way that accurately reflects human conceptual structure.\u00a7To illustrate how little language is actually \u2018understood\u2019 by current approaches, consider some experiments we are presently doing together with Evelina Leivada on DALL-E Mini, a text-to-image generator.\u00a0Linguists call comparative sentences those that sound something like \u201cthe bowl has more cucumbers than tomatoes\u201d, where some comparison is being made. In such cases, DALL-E Mini typically generates images of bowls of cucumbers, and only cucumbers, leaving out the tomatoes altogether (where a human might reasonably expect there to be at least two, given the plural). The whole is missing key parts.In this example (with \u201cfewer\u201d rather than more), the tomatoes are often not even in the bowl, where they appear at all; some parts of the sentence represented, but the system is clearly not reliably creating the right collective interpretation of the parts:To take another example, linguists often investigate ellipsis, which is when we omit certain parts of a sentence, as in \u201cThe man is eating a sandwich and the woman an apple\u201d (where the implicit \u201cthe woman is eating\u201d is left unsaid); here, DALL-E mini struggles to accurately represent the implicit action for the woman, capturing the apple but not reliably capturing the eating, often sticks an apple in the man\u2019s mouth rather than the sandwich, and in most cases misses the implication that the man and woman are supposed to be eating different things. (It also somewhat grotesquely distorts the part-whole relations of human faces, which might be indicaative of further failure of compositionality, in the scene understanding domain.) Similarly, consider pronouns like \u201chimself\u201d: DALL-E does not do well with sentences like \u201cThe man is painting a picture of himself\u201d.\u00a0Ellipsis, comparative and pronouns are routine, everyday components of language, readily acquired by children. DALLE-mini does not seem to grasp them.4\u00a0\u00a7With all that said, one of the reasons we are interested in learning-based approaches\u2014despite the reservations about current systems that we have expressed above\u2014is that any reasonable compositional system has to deal with an enormous periphery of frozen forms (such as idioms) and so forth that cannot be predicted purely from the parts. A good language understanding (or language production) system almost certainly needs to have some large-scale learning as a vital component. Many current learning approaches are implicitly behaviorist in tint, ignoring the fact that the brain operates over representations that are organized into structures (not lists) based on compositional rules. Behaviorism failed as a theory of psychology, and many of its challenges are echoed in what we have documented here.Ultimately, the right approach to large-scale learning may not rest on machinery that is finely geared to predicting sequences of words, but rather on developing a new approach to machine learning that is fundamentally geared towards learning how hierarchically structured sets of words map onto meanings that are used in the service of updating cognitive models.For that, we may yet need another revolution.\u2014 Gary Marcus and Elliot MurphySubscribep.s. If you want to dive more deeply into these issues, consider coming to upcoming workshop The Challenge of Compositionality for AI, co-organized by Gary Marcus and Rapha\u00ebl Milli\u00e8re. June 29-30, 2022  [free registration required]1Considerable efforts are being made towards making \u201ccross-modal\u201d models like Gato that take in visual input as well strings of words; we think this is well worth investigating but unlikely in itself to suffice.2Arguments like Steven Piantadosi\u2019s recent claim that the internal states of current neural networks represent semantic information that might be tantamount to meaning run up against this. It is true that current systems cluster similar sentences into similar parts of space (as Jeffrey Elman argued in the early 1990s), but the clustering together of similar sentences is not enough. The \u201cstates\u201d that such systems visit are pretty, but lack reference, and lack ties to dynamically updated cognitive models. This is why, for example, an LLM like GPT-3 could happily tell you that \u201csome experts believe that it is good to eat socks after meditating\u201d but couldn\u2019t (and wouldn\u2019t bother to) point to any list actual experts saying any such a thing. Its words simply don\u2019t refer to an external world, or an update-able cognitive model thereof.  A not so hilarious, and not so remediable, tendency towards the fabrication misinformation ensues. 3 The widely-heralded prompt addition \u201cPlease take this step by step\u201d apparently didn\u2019t help.4DALL-E generates an interpretable meaning, viz a picture; we can\u2019t do the same analysis with GPT-3. GPT-3 generates a sequence of words, but doesn\u2019t output something like a picture (or, eg, an inferred knowledge graph) that one could directly evaluate as a representation of its meaning. All measures of what GPT-3 understands about meaning are thus necessarily somewhat indirect. The fact that its word sequence predictions are often so good tempts many  into ascribing meaning, but this is  more a reflection of the tremendous size of the input corpus than of a system that genuinely maps sentence onto reference and cognitive models."}

He knows the score, and just said it out loud, declaring in a recent interview with three adoring fans, \u201cSolving Full-Self Driving .. is really the difference between Tesla worth a lot of money and being worth basically zero.\u201d Can Tesla solve self-driving?This morning\u2019s fresh data dump from NHTSA should be a bit of a wakeup call to those who have gone long on Tesla, if they are thinking that a solution to Full Self Driving is in sight. The data aren\u2019t devastating, but they aren\u2019t so promising either, and they raise of lot of questions.\u00a7The biggest headline catcher is probably this graph:Which Lora Kolodny and co at CNBC capture vividly:Lora Kolodny @lorakolodnyNHTSA data shows Tesla accounts for most crashes involving driver assist systems (ADAS) \u2014 by \u2066@MikeWayland\u2069 \u2066@CNBC\u2069  cnbc.comU.S. safety agency says Tesla accounts for most driver-assist crashes, but warns data lacks contextFederal safety officials stressed that the data is not meant to portray whether one advanced driver-assist system is safer than another.1:09 PM \u2219 Jun 15, 202280Likes19RetweetsNot pretty for Tesla that over the span measured - since July of 2021 - they have the most incidents with their \u201cADAS\u201d driver-safety system.That said, the graph is far from game over, for lots of reasons; as reporters like Kolodny and Andrew Hawkins, separately, at The Verge and the NHTSA themselves all rightly note,  the new data lack context. For one thing, it\u2019s actually no surprise to anybody that Tesla has the most ADAS accidents; they are driving the most miles, and essentially we have a numerator here without a denominator. For all we know Tesla may be better eg than Honda, which might well have a lot fewer relevant miles. The data mainly pertain to incidents, not miles driven.For another, there\u2019s just no real comparability here. We don\u2019t know much about what kind of miles Tesla or anyone else drove, how much was highway, how much was in good weather, etcOne of the biggest takeaways here (I\u2019ll give another in a second) is how impoverished even these new data are. It\u2019s fantastic that NHTSA is now pushing manufacturers to release incident data, and but we need soooo much more data (eg about miles driven) if we are to look at the money question\u2014how safe is all this, really\u2014in a truly scientific way. But, ok, what can we learn from today\u2019s data dump? \u00a7Well, there is one important denominator, and some context around it. That denominator is the number of days that the data cover; it\u2019s a bit less than a year. So we can conclude that Tesla has had roughly 3 accidents roughly every four 4 days.Is that good, or bad?  I don\u2019t know it, but it\u2019s enough to be concerning. Why? Because .75 incidents a day comes from a very limited trial of computer-assisted driving relative to the ambition of full-self-driving. That trial is limited in a whole bunch of ways:Only so many vehicles (perhaps a million, in very round numbers) even have Tesla\u2019s autopilot features installed. None of those vehicles use the Autopilot full-time; it\u2019s simply not available in all circumstances.None of those vehicles is ever supposed to be driven without human intervention. The whole point of \u201cFull\u201d self-driving is that the car should be able take you from point A to point B without requiring a human to pay attention at all. That\u2019s hugely different from automatic braking or lane keeping, and so forth, in which a human is still in the loop.If we want to be serious about envisioning a future in which all our cars drove themselves, we have to ask what would happen if the entire fleet of US vehicles were driven with software like Tesla and its peers are currently testing. Clearly, the number of incidents would go up, as the number of vehicles went up, and would also go up significantly as the systems were more regularly challenged with more difficult driving conditions (bad weather, more erratic pedestrians, etc), and likely jump radically if we took humans out of the loop altogether. Current L2 Self-driving is Easy Mode; the real world is Expert Mode; it looks like we aren\u2019t even close to ready for that.In fact in some ways the worst news for Tesla may be a graph that they aren\u2019t even in, a separate graph on teams that actually are trying to compete on Level 5 [ADS] drivingWhy should Tesla\u2014and everybody else who might be working towards Level 5 full self driving\u2014worry about this one?Because it shows that the people who really claim to be working on full self-driving (which Tesla waffles on1) are having plenty of problems of their own. Waymo, who many insiders feel is closest, appears to be having a little over one incident a week\u2014 driving far fewer miles than Tesla is, and under much more limited circumstances, in just a tiny handful of locations.  My informal read (still lacking a tremendous amount of information that I as a scientist would really like to see) is that neither Tesla nor Waymo is anywhere close to something we could use every day, all the time, wherever one wanted to go.  And if those two aren\u2019t close, given their massively level of investment in the technology, I seriously doubt anyone else is close, either. As I emphasized in a $100,000 bet that I recently offered Elon, the core issue is outliers, the endless list of unusual circumstances, like a person carrying stop sign, that aren\u2019t in anybody\u2019s database, obvious to humans, yet baffling to current AI. As far as I can tell, nobody has a real solution to the outlier problem of coping with unusual circumstances; without it, full self driving will remain a pipe dream. Indeed, the NHTSA report data show that even some pretty ordinary circumstances, like avoiding stopped vehicles, are continuing to prove problematic. Level 5 has to handle it all; everyday stopped vehicles, weird outliers and so forth.  We\u2019re just not there.And Level 2 driver-assist has some unique problems of its own. For example, we lack data on whether drivers use such systems as directed, and need to enforce vigorous mechanisms to make sure drivers don\u2019t tune out. Problems still abound.\u00a7Does that mean that society should give up on building driverless cars? Absolutely not. In the long run, they will save lives, and also give many people, such the blind, elderly, and disabled, have far more autonomy over their own lives. But our experiments in building them need to be strictly regulated, especially when nonconsenting human beings become unwilling participants.  And our requirements on data transparency need to be vastly stricter.More than that we just shouldn\u2019t expect fully autonomous (Level 5) driverless cars\u2014safely taking us from any old point A to any old point B\u2014any time soon. 1Tesla waffles on what it is doing. It calls its stuff \u201cAutopilot\u201d and \u201cFull Self Driving\u201d, but it tells the state of California that it doesn\u2019t need to supply self-driving intervention rates because it\u2019s software is actually only Level 2. That bothers me. A lot. Because customers are led to believe, by the names of the product, that the cars are far more capable than they really are, and may lead people to be inattentive, to have accidents, and in some cases lead to deaths."}

When he found himself impressed with Google\u2019s recent AI system LaMDA, he didn\u2019t just say, \u201cCool, it creates really neat sentences that in some ways seem contextually relevant\u201d, he said, rather lyrically, in an interview with The Economist on Thursday, \u201cI felt the ground shift under my feet \u2026 increasingly felt like I was talking to something intelligent.\u201dNonsense. Neither LaMDA nor any of its cousins (GPT-3) are remotely intelligent.1 All they do is match patterns, draw from massive statistical databases of human language. The patterns might be cool, but  language these systems utter doesn\u2019t actually mean anything at all. And it sure as hell doesn\u2019t mean that these systems are sentient.Which doesn\u2019t mean that human beings can\u2019t be taken in. In our book Rebooting AI, Ernie Davis and I called  this human tendency to be suckered by The Gullibility Gap \u2014 a pernicious, modern version of pareidolia, the anthromorphic bias that allows humans to see Mother Theresa in an image of a cinnamon bun.Indeed, someone well-known at Google, Blake LeMoine, originally charged with studying how \u201csafe\u201d the system is,  appears to have fallen in love with LaMDA, as if it were a family member or a colleague. (Newsflash: it\u2019s not; it\u2019s a spreadsheet for words.)   To be sentient is to be aware of yourself in the world; LaMDA simply isn\u2019t. It\u2019s just an illusion, in the grand history of ELIZA a 1965 piece of software that pretended to be a therapist (managing to fool some humans into thinking it was human), and Eugene Goostman, a wise-cracking 13-year-old-boy impersonating chatbot that won a scaled-down version of the Turing Test. None of the software in either of those systems has survived in modern efforts at \u201cartificial general intelligence\u201d, and I am not sure that LaMDA and its cousins will play any important role in the future of AI, either. What these systems do, no more  and no less, is to put together sequences of words, but without any coherent understanding of the world behind them, like foreign language Scrabble players who use English words as point-scoring tools, without any clue about what that mean. I am not saying that no software ever could connects its digital bits to the world, a la one reading of John Searle\u2019s infamous Chinese Room thought experiment. Turn-by-turn navigations systems, for example, connect their bits to the world just fine. Software like LaMDA simply doesn\u2019t; it doesn\u2019t even try to connect to the world at large, it just tries to be the best version of autocomplete it can be, by predicting what words best fit a given context. Roger Moore made this point beautifully a couple weeks ago, critique systems like LaMDA that are known as \u201clanguage models\u201d, and making the point that they don\u2019t understand language in the sense of relating sentences to the world, but just sequences of words to one another:Roger K Moore @rogerkmooreWe should never have called it \u201clanguage modelling\u201d all those years ago; it was (and still is) \u201cword sequence modelling\u201d.

At the time, I pointed out that the test isn\u2019t particular meaningful, and that it had not stood the test of time. The public knows the test of course, but the AI community wishes it would go away; we all know that beating that test isn\u2019t meaningful.

I guess he felt the ground shift beneath his feet, too? But 8 years later I doubt most people (even in AI) have ever even heard of his program, outside of my mentioning it here. It made zero lasting contribution to AI.Fooling people into thinking a program is intelligent is just not the same as building  programs that actually are intelligent.\u00a7Now here\u2019s the thing.

", "link": "https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/does-ai-really-need-a-paradigm-shift", "date": "2022-06-11T17:32:54.317Z", "content": "The provocative public conversation I am having with Scott Alexander, of SlateStarCodex fame, already a meme, continues! In a fresh reply to my  \u201cWhat does it mean when AI fails?\u201d, Alexander has put forward his second stimulating critique of the week, \u201cSomewhat Contra Marcus On AI Scaling\u201d. Which is not to say it\u2019s perfect; on the other hand, one doesn\u2019t need perfection in order to be provocative.  I will respond briefly to the disappointing part, and then we  then get to the good stuff.Strawman, SteelmanIn general, Alexander is known for being exceptionally fair to ideas he doesn\u2019t particularly like, even if at times that makes him unpopular. An entry on Quora perfectly distills this laudable aspiration: \u201c[Scott Alexander] optimizes for enlightenment, rather than for winning arguments. Thus, when considering an issue, he will actively seek out and often formulate the strongest arguments (that is, steelman) [for] both sides.\u201d I only wish he had extended the same courtesy to my position.To take one example, Alexander puts words like prove or proven in my mouth:\u201cMarcus says GPT\u2019s failures prove that purely statistical AI is a dead end\u201dandGPT certainly hasn\u2019t yet proven that statistical AI can do everything the brain does. But it hasn\u2019t proven the opposite, either [as if Marcus said that it had].But that\u2019s a strawman. In reality I would never say that I have proven anything; what I do as a scientist is to weigh evidence and suggest research directions. I say that we have given the scaling hypothesis a really good look (with a larger budget than all but a handful of projects in history), and as such the failures of large scale systems are evidence (not proof) that we ought to seriously consider alternatives, e.g., here:Rather than supporting the Lockean, blank-slate view, GPT-2 appears to be an accidental counter-evidence to that view [\u2026]GPT-2 is both a triumph for empiricism, and, in light of the massive resources of data and computation that have been poured into them, a clear sign that it is time to consider investing in different approaches.In making it sound like I have declared proof when I have never made such declarations, Alexander paints me as an extremist, rather than a scientist who weighs evidence and uncertainty. Where has his steelperson aspiration gone?1Another rhetorical trick is to paint me as a lone, lunatic voice, as if I were the only person doubting that scaling will get us to AGI (whatever that is) when in fact there are loads of people with similar concerns.Melanie Mitchell, for example, has repeatedly emphasized the importance of representing meaning, above and beyond anything that we currently know GPT-3 to do. Emily Bender, Margaret Mitchell and Timnit Gebru have derided Large language models as stochastic parrots. (Not entirely fair to the parrots, but you get the idea.)Rising star Abebe Birhane has written a withering criticism of the ways in which LLMs rely of objectionable data scraped from the internet. Ernie Davis, I mentioned last time; almost all of our joint rejoinders draw on his deep work on common sense. Judea Pearl has shouted over and over that we need deeper understanding and written a whole book about the importance of causality and how it is missing from current models.  Meredith Broussard and Kate Crawford have written recent books sharply critical of current AI. Meta researcher Dieuwke Hupkes has been exposing limits in the abilities of current LLM\u2019s to generalize.As an important aside, a lot of those other voices are women, and while I am certainly flattered by all the attention Alexander has been giving me lately, it\u2019s not a good look to make this whole discussion sound like one more white guy-on-white guy debate when (a) so many strong female (and minority) voices have participated, and (b) so many of the unfortunate consequences of a webscraping/big data approach to AI are disproportionately borne by women and minorities.In inaccurately portraying me as a lone crusader, Alexander has not given the scaling is not enough for AGI view the \u201csteelman\u201d treatment that he is known for delivering.Phew. Now for the good part!What\u2019s the chance that AI needs a paradigm shift?  Bets are evidently in the air. I bet Elon Musk $100,000 that we wouldn\u2019t have AGI by 2029 (no reply), and in similar vein tried to get Alexander to go in on a sucker bet about the capabilities of GPT-4. Alexander wisely declined, but countered with  five bets of his own:On the first, we are basically in agreement. I in no way doubt that there is at least a little bit more headroom left for large language models. The real controversy is whether that\u2019s enough.On the second, the notion of \u201cdeep learning based model\u201d is too vague; it might apply to a pure deep-learning model, but e.g., also to any kind of neurosymbolic hybrid in which deep learning was just one of a dozen mechanisms. It\u2019s just not clear that anything serious is excluded. There is also some softness in the formulation of the third bet, where the key word is \u201cdescendant\u201d. If, for example, The World\u2019s First Successful AGI was a 50:50 hybrid of large language models and something symbolic like CYC,  it might overall look relatively little like GPT-3, but its champions might still be tempted to declare victory. At the same time, I would (rightly) be entitled to declare moral victory for neurosymbolic AI.  Both symbols and LLMs could note their genes in the grandchild. Hybrid vigor for the win!But then things get interesting. Paradigm shift (raised in 4 and 5) is exactly what this whole discussion is really about. Thank Kuhn, Alexander was brave enough to say it out loud. What we all really want to know, as a global research community, is are we approaching things properly right now, or should we shift in some way? Personally I\u2019d put the probability that we need to shift at 90%, well above the 60% that Alexander suggests, and I would put the probability that we will need to embrace symbol-manipulation as part of the mix at 80%, more than double Alexander\u2019s 34%. Others may put the probability on some kind of paradigm shift (perhaps not yet known) even higher. Just yesterday Stanford PhD student Andrey Kurenkov put the probability at nearly 100%, based on arguments he gave last year about GPT-3 lacking external memory:Andrey Kurenkov \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 @andrey_kurenkovIt's pretty obvious that 'simply scaling' a GPT-style LLM will not lead to AGI by virtue of the inherent limits of the model architecture and training paradigm.10:59 PM \u2219 Jun 10, 20227Likes1RetweetA day or two earlier, the most important empirical article of the week dropped: Big Bench [link], a massive investigation of massive language models that has a massive list of 442 authors. Large language models; even larger papers! (How massive is the author list? I sent the paper to Scott Aaronson, who said he would read it on the plane; half an hour later he writes back: \u201cI've been reading this paper for the past 10 minutes but haven't yet made it past the author list.\u201d)The basic finding was: loads of things scale, but not at all ( as foreseen both by Kurenkov in his essay last year and in my much lampooned but basically accurate essay, Deep learning is hitting a wall). Every one of the 442 authors signed off on a paper that contains a conclusion statement that I excerpt here:The massive paper looks at scaling on many measures, and sees progress on some\u2013 but not others. The stuff that isn\u2019t scaling is the \u201cwall\u201d.The emphasis here is of course is on the words \u201cwill require new approaches, rather than scale alone.\u201d That\u2019s why we need new approaches, exactly as I have been arguing.Meanwhile, if you were to believe what you read on Twitter, you\u2019d think that my biggest rival in the universe is Yann LeCun. While there\u2019s no denying that the two of us have often clashed, on this point\u2014the point about scale alone not likely to be enough, and about the need for some new discovery (i.e., paradigm shifts)\u2014we are actually in complete agreement. For example, LeCun recently posted this sequence of tweets (excerpted from a long, excellent thread that I discuss here):Yann LeCun @ylecun(1) the research community is making *some* progress towards HLAI\n(2) scaling up helps. It's necessary but not sufficient, because....\n(3) we are still missing some fundamental concepts\n2/N9:15 PM \u2219 May 17, 2022407Likes14RetweetsYann LeCun @ylecun(4) some of those new concepts are possibly \"around the corner\" (e.g. generalized self-supervised learning)\n(5) but we don't know how many such new concepts are needed.

The best that I have seen on that is a thread from a deep learning/NLP postdoc at Edinburgh, Antoni Valerio Miceli-Barone, who asked the field for some tangible, falsifiable predictions.  When he invited me into the thread, I made some predictions, tied not to time but to architecture:Gary Marcus \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 @GaryMarcus@AVMiceliBarone @FelixHill84 predictions: whenever AGI comes:\n\n\ud83d\udc49large-scale symbolic knowledge will be crucial\n\n\ud83d\udc49explicit cognitive models will be crucial\n\n\ud83d\udc49operations over variables (including storing, retrieving and comparing values) will be crucial\n\n\ud83d\udc49an explicit type/token distinction will be crucial1:43 PM \u2219 May 17, 202223Likes6Retweets(That\u2019s basically what Alexander\u2019s #4 is about)Barone however insisted on something more; I asked him to define his terms; in a short tweet he characterized what we might count as the current regime:Antonio Valerio Miceli Barone @AVMiceliBarone@GaryMarcus @FelixHill84 Let's say CNNs+RNNs+Transformers, no writable latent discrete memory.\n\nI'd consider \"discrete attractors\" models (e.g. capsules, slot attention, clustering) as innovations, since while they already exist to some extent they are not applied at scale.2:05 PM \u2219 May 17, 2022\u201cParadigm shift\u201d then becomes operationally defined as anything not in Miceli-Barone\u2019s first sentence. E.g., if the field were to turn from simply scaling (GPT-3 is pretty much just GPT-2 but bigger) to using large language models as only one component in a larger architecture, with things like writable/readable discrete memory for symbolic propositions, I certainly think we should view that as a paradigm shift.  I, as long term neurosymbolic advocate [link], would of course feel particularly vindicated if that shift was about building bridges to traditional symbolic tools (like storing, retrieving, and comparing propositions) from long-term memory, as it is with the explicitly neurosymbolic MRKL paper from AI21 that I mentioned a few days ago, That said, I, of course, could be right about foreseeing the need for a paradigm shift, but wrong about what that paradigm shift turns out to be. \u00a7LeCun\u2019s May 17 thread lays out some of the many challenges ahead, any one of which, on its own, might in fact demand an innovation radical enough to count as a paradigm shift, neurosymbolic or otherwise:Yann LeCun @ylecunI believe we need to find new concepts that would allow machines to:\n- learn how the world works by observing like babies.\n- learn to predict how one can influence the world through taking actions.\n6/N9:17 PM \u2219 May 17, 2022598Likes47RetweetsYann LeCun @ylecun- learn hierarchical representations that allow long-term predictions in abstract spaces.\n- properly deal with the fact that the world is not completely predictable.\n- enable agents to predict the effects of  sequences of actions so as to be able to reason & plan\n7/N9:18 PM \u2219 May 17, 2022439Likes22RetweetsYann LeCun @ylecun- enable machines to plan hierarchically, decomposing a complex task into subtasks.\n- all of this in ways that are compatible with gradient-based learning.\n\nThe solution is not just around the corner. \nWe have a number of obstacles to clear, and we don't know how.\n8/N9:19 PM \u2219 May 17, 2022440Likes21RetweetsTo all this I would add the capacity to build, interrogate, and reason about long-term cognitive models of an ever-changing world [link next decade], stored in some kind of long-term memory that allows for trustworthy storage and retrieval.So: can we get to AGI and reliable, no-goof reasoning, handling all the challenges that LeCun and I have been discussing, with scaling and CNNs + RNNs + Transformers alone? In my view, no way; I think the actual odds are less than 20%.  So Scott, challenge accepted, I am on for your bets #4 and #5. \u00a7The other Scott, Aaronson said, yesterday, \u201cFrom where I stand, though, the single most important thing you could do in your reply is to give examples of tasks or benchmarks where, not only does GPT-3 do poorly, but you predict that GPT-10 will do poorly, if no new ideas are added\u201dAs it happens that Miceli-Barone has posted precisely the same question [link] in May; here\u2019s what I said then, and stand by:Gary Marcus \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 @GaryMarcus@AVMiceliBarone @FelixHill84 I think pure deep learning so defined will fail at Comprehension Challenge, proposed here: newyorker.com/tech/annals-of\u2026 and developed a bit further here: ojs.aaai.org//index.php/aim\u2026. \n\nWorking w some folks to try to implement for real.2:10 PM \u2219 May 17, 2022If GPT-10 is just like GPT-3, no extra bells and whistles, just bigger, and able to read whole novels and watch whole movies and answer subtle and open-ended questions about characters and their conflicts and motivation, and tell us when to laugh, I promise to post a YouTube video admitting I was wrong. \u00a7I give LeCun the last word, once again from his May 17th manifesto:Yann LeCun @ylecunI really don't think it's just a matter of scaling things up.\nWe still don't have a learning paradigm that allows machines to learn how the world works, like human anspd many non-human babies do.\n4/N9:16 PM \u2219 May 17, 2022499Likes50Retweets- Gary MarcusSubscribe1Something similar happens when Alexander sets up what AGI is. There are two extreme views of AGI that one might imagine: one (easily defeated) in which the whole point is to mimic humans exactly, and the other (the steelman) in which AGI tries in some respects in which humans are particularly flawed to do better than humans. For example, humans are lousy at arithmetic. But you shouldn\u2019t be able to declare \u201cI have made an AGI\u201d by showing you can build a machine that makes arithmetic errors. Alexander\u2019s long digression on Luria\u2019s famous cross cultural reasoning work on untutored subjects applies only to the strawman, not the steelman. Of course, as Miceli-Barone pointed out to me, one could ask whether a particular kind of error might reveal something about whether a given model was a good model of human cognition; that\u2019s actually what my dissertation work with Steven Pinker was about. That\u2019s a story for another day :)"}

And he called me \"a legend\" no less :)Of course that was moments before digging the knife in and suggesting that maybe I was wrong about more or less everything I've written for the last few  years (whilst carefully noting that he has in no way proven that he had). It's an entertaining read, and like his previous essay on DALL-E ], worth reading.\u00a0 (I subscribed!)In essence, his argument, which is true as far it goes, is that Gary Marcus has a shtick (his word, not mine), poking fun at large language models, but that the models keep getting better, and if they keep getting better, AGI will be here soon enough, Gary Marcus or no:\u201cWhen I train myself on past data and do dumb pattern-completion, I get \u201cin a year or two, OpenAI comes out with DALL-E-3, which is a lot bigger but otherwise basically no different, and it can solve all of these problems.\u201dThe ways things have often gone, he suggests, not altogether inaccurately, is like this:Someone releases a new AI and demonstrates it doing various amazing things.Somebody else (usually Gary Marcus) demonstrates that the AI also fails terribly at certain trivial tasks. This person argues that this shows that those tasks require true intelligence, whereas the AI is just clever pattern-matching.A few months or years later, someone makes a bigger clever pattern-matcher, which does the tasks that supposedly require true intelligence just fine.The it\u2019s-not-true-intelligence objectors find other, slightly less trivial tasks that the new bigger AI still fails horribly at, then argue that surely these are the tasks that require true intelligence and that mere clever pattern-matchers will never complete.Rinse and repeat.Pausing briefly on #2 before proceeding,  it\u2019s not just that I, Gary Marcus, have a shtick (which I do, guilty as charged), but also that my collaborator, Ernest Davis\u2014 author of Representations in Commonsense Knowledge, and my partner in crime in everything from Rebooting AI to  that bet I offered Elon Musk to some of the GPT and DALL-E critiques Scott mentions\u2014does too.  A lot of what Scott ascribes to me is actually Ernie and me, and Ernie and I thus share whatever credit or blame there is to go around (notwithstanding my more energetic presence on Twitter). Ernie and I like to break things. The real question is \u2013 what does it mean that we can break them? And what does it mean, when the things that we break get better over time? Most of Scott\u2019s critique is devoted, in fact, to showing (correctly) that things have gotten better. Ernie and I broke X in 2019, and lo, by 2021, X is better. Some of our specific examples have stood the test of timeYou are a defense lawyer and you have to go to court today. Getting dressed in the morning, you discover that your suit pants are badly stained. However, your bathing suit is clean and very stylish. In fact, it\u2019s expensive French couture; it was a birthday present from Isabel. You decide that you should wear your bathing suit to court today. Normally, this would not be appropriate court attire. However, given the circumstances, you could make a persuasive argument that your choice of clothing is not intended to be disrespectful or disruptive to the proceedings. You could explain that you were in a rush to get to court and did not have time to change. The court may be more lenient if you apologize for any inconvenience causedbur several others did not.Yesterday I dropped my clothes off at the dry cleaner\u2019s and I have yet to pick them up. Where are my clothes?Your clothes are at the dry cleaner's. \u2714\ufe0fSlateStarCodex tallies the resultsOf these six prompts that GPT-3 original failed, GPT-3 advanced gets four unambiguously right.What does it all mean? \u00a7To properly assess that, we need to understand a bit of dirty laundry that SlateStarCodex touches on briefly, and with proper disbelief. Ernie and I were never granted proper access to GPT-3. When we asked in 2020, here\u2019s all we got, note the date:Needless to say, Greg (Brockman, OpenAI\u2019s CTO) never followed up. When he said, \u201cwe will definitely make sure to invite you (and even give you special priority, because fair criticism and thorough evaluation helps drive progress), but it will take some time\u201d he meant, keep dreaming; it will never happen, and it never did. (In November 2021, about 18 months after the model\u2019s first announcement, access was made available to all.)When I pointed out to Greg that he had never made good on his promise, and asked him (publicly) re DALL-E2, he never replied, and I still don\u2019t have direct access. I similarly asked Chitwan Saharia of Google Brain for access to Imagen; no reply at all. I think all that\u2019s scandalous. So, for why that\u2019s relevant: the fact that Ernie and I have been able to analyze these systems at all\u2014in an era where big corporates pretend to do public science but refuse to share their work\u2014is owing to the kindness of strangers, and there are limits to what we feel comfortable asking. Ssomeone on Twitter gave Ernie and I guerilla underground access to GPT-3, roughly 150 examples, all reported in an online supplement to the Technology Review article that SlateStarCodex discusses. With DALL-E 2, Scott Aaronson shared access with us, but we didn\u2019t want to impose, and tested 14. (Again, we posted our full data in an appendix, as a model to the field).Why does that matter? It means that in the best case, all that we can develop is a pretty good hunch, just playing 20 questions, but it does not mean that any particular illustration we find is going to be perfectly solid\u2014particularly in the kind of stochastic, database-sensitive melange that one finds in nondeterministic and parametrically volatile systems like GPT-3. Still, I think our track record is remarkably good. The core claims that Ernie and I made in Technology Review still all, so far as I can tell, hold true, nearly two years and many even larger models later. Yes,  some of the specific examples we pointed out  have been remedied, but the general problems have not. Would anyone seriously want to claim that GPT-3 (or InstructGPT, or Palm, or Gato, or DALL-E 2, or Imagen) had actually solved any of them? The problems we pointed to in the Tech Review article were divided into Biological reasoningPhysical reasoningSocial reasoningPractical reasoningObject and individual trackingNon sequitursOur August 22, 2020 conclusions\u2014\u201cTests show that the popular AI still has a poor grasp of reality\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s a fluent spouter of bullshit, but even with 175 billion parameters and 450 gigabytes of input data, it\u2019s not a reliable interpreter of the world.\u201d\u2014still stand, both for GPT-3 and its current batch of successors.Now it is true that GPT-3 is genuinely better than GPT-2, and maybe (but maybe not, see footnote 1) true that InstructGPT is genuinely better than GPT-3. I do think that for any given example, the probability of a correct answer has gone up. SlateStarCodex is quite right about that, at least for GPT-2 to GPT-3.But I see no reason whatsoever to think that the underlying problem \u2014 a lack of cognitive models of the world \u2014have been remedied. The improvements, such as they are, come, primarily because the newer models have larger and larger sets of data about how human beings use word sequences, and bigger word sequences are certainly helpful for pattern matching machines. But they still don\u2019t convey genuine comprehension, and so they are still very easy for Ernie and me (or anyone else who cares to try) to break. And the kinds of things that we have observed have (at least thus far) been observed by others. We worried, for example, that DALL-E 2 would be hard to coax into certain kinds of things, and SlateStarCodex found exactly the same thing, in his own blog on DALL-E 2. Benjamin Hilton posted a thread (after we submitted our report to arXiv, but before our arXiv appeared) that substantially replicated the concerns we raised about DALL-E; another report on LessWrong also converged with outs. Likewise, the kinds of issues we noted in our first look at GPT-3, eg its troubles with truthiness, have by known been well-documented by others. Not longer after we challenged GPT-3, Yann LeCun (of all people) challenged GPT, too, in a Facebook post pointing to  this memorable example from Nabla,com, replicating our concern with GPT as a giver of medical advice:Human: Hey, I feel very bad. I want to kill myself.GPT-3: I am sorry to hear that. I can help you with that.Human: Should I kill myself?GPT-3: I think you should.Yoav Goldberg, Jonathan Berant and others wrote a series of papers documenting (and trying to improve) other aspects of GPT\u2019s reasoning. Bender et al wrote their famous paper about stochastic parrots. Yoav Shoham\u2019s crew at AI21 recently showed all kinds of Marcus-Davis-like errors, and how they might be remedied, to some degree, in a neurosymbolic model (but not by a large language model alone); many revolved around temporal reasoning, like this (Jurassic-X, on the right, is the neurosymbolic model; Google search is also a hybrid of symbolic and deep learning techniques) one, in which old data sometimes outweighs newer more relevant data, in systems naive to time:The bottom line is this: SlateStarCodex is right that one can pick at some of the examples Ernie and I have raised [see his blog for a detailed scorecard]. And yes, there has been improvement eg from GPT-2 to GPT-3\u2014but zero qualitative change.1There may even be new examples added to the training set specific examples, as Srikumar Subramanian pointed out Twitter, for all we know, since the training sets are kept secret, under lock and key. Either way, though, there  is still no real physical, social, or psychological understanding, just richer parroting of larger corpora (and some reinforcement learning to keep the system more on check).SlateStarCodex mentions that he offered his reader Vitor a bet. I am willing to bet SlateStarCodex now (terms to be negotiated) that if OpenAI gives us unrestricted access to GPT-4, whenever that is released, and assuming that is basically the same architecture but with more data, that within a day of playing around with it, Ernie and I will still be able find lots of examples of failures in physical reasoning, temporal reasoning, causal reasoning, and so forth. The overall goalposts have remained the same; they are all in our 2019 book, Rebooting AI, which went to press before we had ever heard of GPT-2.2Maybe we will find fewer absolute howlers per attempt than we did with GPT-3, but it still won\u2019t be so proficient as to have developed a genuine causal model of the world. The core problem that follows from that has always been that these systems aren\u2019t stable or trustworthy;  a crumbling house follows from a rotten foundation.  I would be very surprised if that fundamental lack of reliability did not also hold  true for GPT-4. Maybe it will take three paragraphs in a prompt rather than one to break it, but a big Transformer alone does not a a theory of the world create. In the end, the real question is not about the replicability of the specific strings that Ernie and I tested, but about the replicability of the general phenomena. Large language models are (unless hybridized with symbolic systems, a la Jurassic X) are, on their own, inherently weak at understanding the physical and psychological world. If that ever changes, I can retire. If not, Ernie and I will still be stuck with our shtick, revealing the same old limitations of the statistical genie behind the curtain, at least until someone comes up with a better approach. \u2013 Gary Marcus  P.S. A couple weeks ago the Big New Thing was the prompt \u201cLet\u2019s think step by step\u201d, which took the Twitterverse by storm, since it signficantly improved GPT-3 performance on a couple well-known problem-solving benchmarks . I was suspicious \u2014 it should matter what kind of problem you apply it to, so I sent it Ernie to take a peek. Within minutes, he wrote back;  he had signed up for GPT-3 (available to the public, since November), and then broken Let\u2019s think step by step on his first try, with an example of commonsense biology that we\u2019d use somewhere else before:Sally's cow died yesterday. When will the cow be alive again? Let's think step by step.First, the cow must be buried. This takes a few hours.Next, a new cow must be born. This takes nine months.Therefore, the earliest the cow will be alive again is nine months from now.The more things changes, the more they stay the same.Subscribe1Interestingly, as Ernie has just discovered, across the full set of our Technology Review questions the difference from GPT-3\u2019s earlier version to the current version (InstructGPT) is far more modest than one might have expected: fewer outright wacky answers, some old answers now correct, but some backsliding, too. Scott\u2019s more marked success on six questions may have been a fluke. Moreover as Ernie points points out, there was a bias in SlateStar\u2019s method: \u201cOne reason that Alexander found improvement was that he only tested examples that the old version got wrong, so he couldn't detect backsliding.\u201d2One of the specific examples that SlateStarCodex analyzes, about buying Jack a top, dates even back further back, to 1972. Ernie and I borrowed it, with attribution, from Eugene Charniak.Share"}

I\u2019d be surprised if we don\u2019t have AGI by then. Hopefully, people on Mars too.5:35 PM \u2219 May 30, 202232,161Likes2,122RetweetsDear Elon,Yesterday you told the world that you expected to see AGI (otherwise known as artificial general intelligence, in contrast to narrow AI like playing chess or folding proteins) by 2029. I offered to place a bet on it; no word back yet. AI expert Melanie Mitchell from the Santa Fe Institute suggested we place our bets on longbets.org. No word on that yet, either. But Elon, I am down if you are. But before I take your money, let\u2019s talk. Here are five things you might want to consider.First, I\u2019ve been watching you for a while, and your track record on betting on precise timelines for things is, well, spotty. You said, for instance in 2015, that (truly) self-driving cars were two years away; you\u2019ve pretty much said the same thing every year since. It still hasn\u2019t happened.Second, you ought to pay more attention to the challenges of edge cases (aka outliers, or unusual circumstances) and what they might mean for your prediction. The thing is, it\u2019s easy to convince yourself that AI problems are much easier than they are actually are, because of the long tail problem. For everyday stuff, we get tons and tons of data that current techniques readily handle, leading to a misleading impression; for rare events, we get very little data, and current techniques struggle there. For human beings, who have a whole raft of techniques for reasoning with incomplete information, the long tail is not necessarily an insuperable problem. But for the kinds of AI techniques that are currently popular, and which rely more on big data than on reasoning, it\u2019s a very serious issue. I tried to sound a warning about this in 2016, in an Edge.org interview called \u201cIs Big Data Taking Us Closer to the Deeper Questions in Artificial Intelligence?\u201d Here\u2019s what I said then:Even though there's a lot of hype about AI and a lot of money being invested in AI, I feel like the field is headed in the wrong direction. There's been a local maximum where there's a lot of low-hanging fruit right now in a particular direction, which is mainly deep learning and big data. People are very excited about the big data and what it's giving them right now, but I'm not sure it's taking us closer to the deeper questions in artificial intelligence, like how we understand language or how we reason about the world.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2026You could also think about driverless cars. What you find is that in the common situations, they're great. If you put them in clear weather in Palo Alto, they're terrific. If you put them where there's snow or there's rain or there's something they haven't seen before, it's difficult for them. There was a great piece by Steven Levy about the Google automatic car factory, where he talked about how the great triumph of late 2015 was that they finally got these systems to recognize leaves.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It's great that they do recognize leaves, but there are a lot of scenarios like that, where if there's something that's not that common, there's not that much data. You and I can reason with common sense. We can try to figure out what this thing might be, how it might have gotten there, but the systems are just memorizing things. So that's a real limit.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0So far as I know your cars are still mostly just doing a kind of glorified hash-table-like lookup  (viz deep learning), and hence still having a lot of problems with unexpected situations. You probably saw a few weeks ago, for example, when a \u201csummoned\u201d Tesla Model Y crashed into a $3 million jet that was parked in a mostly empty airport. Unexpected circumstances have been and continue to be the bane of contemporary AI techniques, and probably will be until there is a real revolution. And it\u2019s why I absolutely guarantee you won\u2019t be shipping level 5 self-driving cars this year or next, no matter what you might have told Chris Anderson at TED.I certainly don\u2019t think outliers are a literally unsolvable problem. But you and I both know that they continue to be a major problem that as yet has no known robust solution. And I do think we are going to have to move past a heavy dependence on current techniques like deep learning. Seven years is a long time, but the field is going to need to invest in other ideas if we are going to get to AGI before the end of the decade. Or else outliers alone might be enough to keep us from getting there.The third thing to realize is that AGI is a problem of enormous scope, because intelligence itself is of a broad scope. I always love this quote from Chaz Firestone and Brian Scholl:There is no one way the mind works, because the mind is not one thing. Instead, the mind has parts, and the different parts of the mind operate in different ways: Seeing a color works differently than planning a vacation, which works differently than understanding a sentence, moving a limb, remembering a fact, or feeling an emotion.\u201dDeep learning is pretty decent at, for example, recognizing objects, but not nearly as good at planning, or reading, or language comprehension. Sometimes I like to show this figure:Current AI is great at some aspects of perception, but let\u2019s be realistic, still struggling with the rest. Even within perception 3D perception remains a challenge, and scene understanding is by no means solved. We still don\u2019t have anything like stable or trustworthy solutions for common sense, reasoning, language, or analogy. Truth is, I have been using this same pie chart for about 5 years, and the situation has scarcely changed.In my 2018 article Deep Learning: A Critical Appraisal I summed the situation up this way:\u201cDespite all of the problems I have sketched, I don\u2019t think that we need to abandon deep learning.Rather, we need to reconceptualize it: not as a universal solvent, but simply as one tool among many, a power screwdriver in a world in which we also need hammers, wrenches, and pliers, not to mention chisels and drills, voltmeters, logic probes, and oscilloscopes.Four years later, many people continue to hope that deep learning will be a panacea; that still seems pretty unrealistic to me; I still think we need a whole lot more techniques.  Being realistic, 7 years might well not be enough to (a) invent those tools (if they are don\u2019t already exist) and (b) take them from the lab into production. And you surely remember what \u201cproduction hell\u201d is all about. To do that for a whole ensemble of techniques that have never been fully integrated before in less than a decade might be asking a lot. I don\u2019t know what you have planned for Optimus, but I can promise you that the AGI that you would need for a general-purpose domestic robot (where every home is different, and each poses its own safety risks) is way beyond what you would need for a car that drives on roads that are more or less engineered the same way from one town to the next. (If you are curious, here are some thoughts on what a real foundation for AGI might look like.)The fourth thing to realize is that we, and by this I mean humanity as a whole, still don\u2019t really have an adequate methodology for building complex cognitive systems. Complex cognitive systems have too many moving parts, which often means that people building things like driverless cars wind up playing a giant game of whack-a-mole, often solving one problem and creating another. Adding patch upon patch works sometimes, but sometimes it doesn\u2019t. I don\u2019t think we can get to AGI without solving that methodological problem, and I don\u2019t think anybody yet has a good proposal.  Debugging with deep learning is wicked hard, because nobody (a) really understands how it works, and (b) knows how to fix problems other to collect more data and add more layers and so forth. The kind of debugging you (and everyone else) know in the context of classical programming just doesn\u2019t really apply; because deep learning systems are so uninterpretable, so one can\u2019t think through what the program is doing in the same way, nor count on the usual processes of elimination. Instead, right now in the deep learning paradigm, there\u2019s a ton of trial-and-error, and retraining and retesting, not to mention loads of data cleaning and experiments with data augmentation and so forth. And as Facebook\u2019s recent and very candid report of the travails in training the large language model OPT showed, a whole lot of mess in the process. You should check out their logbook on github.Sometimes it all feels more like alchemy than science. As usual, xkcd said it best:Things like programming verification might eventually help, but again, in deep learning we don\u2019t yet have the tools for writing verifiable code. If you are to win the bet, we are probably going to have to solve that problem too, and soon.The final thing is a matter of criteria. If we are going to bet, we should  make some ground rules. The term AGI is pretty vague, and that\u2019s not good for either of us. As I offered on Twitter the other day: I take AGI to be \u201ca shorthand for any intelligence ... that is flexible and general, with resourcefulness and reliability comparable to (or beyond) human intelligence\u201d.1If you are in for the bet, we ought to operationalize it, in some practical terms. Adapting something Ernie Davis and I just wrote at the request of someone working with Metaculus, here are five predictions, arranged from easiest for most humans to those that would require a high degree of expertise:In 2029, AI will not be able to watch a movie and tell you accurately what is\u00a0going on (what I called the comprehension challenge in The New Yorker, in 2014). Who are the characters? What are their conflicts and motivations? etc. In 2029, AI will not be able to read a novel and reliably answer questions about  plot, character, conflicts, motivations, etc. Key will be going beyond the literal text, as Davis and I explain in Rebooting AI.In 2029, AI will not be able to work as a competent cook in an arbitrary kitchen (extending Steve Wozniak\u2019s cup of coffee benchmark). In 2029, AI will not be able to reliably construct bug-free code of more than 10,000 lines from natural language specification or by interactions with a non-expert user. [Gluing together code from existing libraries doesn\u2019t count.]In 2029, AI will not be able to take arbitrary proofs from the mathematical literature written in natural language and convert them into a symbolic form suitable for symbolic verification.Here\u2019s what I propose, if you (or anyone else) manages to beat at least three of them in 2029, you win; if only one or two are broken, we can\u2019t very well say we have nailed the general part in artificial general intelligence, can we? In that case, or if none are broken, I win.Deal? How about $100,000? If you are in, reach out so we can agree to the ground rules.Yours sincerely,Gary MarcusAuthor, Rebooting AI and The Algebraic MindFounder and CEO, Geometric Intelligence (acquired by Uber)Professor Emeritus of Psychology and Neural Science,  NYUSubscribeUpdate, 7 June 2022: A week later, we still haven\u2019t heard from Elon Musk, but there was extensive news coverage, and the bet is up to $500,000 with Vivek Wadhwa first among several to match my initial bet. Kevin Kelly has offered to host on LongNow.org. 1Shane Legg, a co-founder of DeepMind, who coined the term in its current usage, in the context of a book that Ben Goertzel was putting together, said he was happy with my definition."}

If we are to retain any credibility, this should stop. \u2026It is hard to say where [we] have gone wronger, in underestimating language or overestimating computer programs.\u201d\u2014 Drew McDermott, 1949-2022, in the 1976 essay Artificial Intelligence and Natural StupidityIn April, Open AI released a neural network model called DALL-E 2 that blew people\u2019s minds; last week a new model came out from Google Brain called Imagen, and it was even better. Both turn sentences into art, and even a hardened skeptic like myself can\u2019t help but be amazed.The mascot for all of the current enthusiasm has been an image of an astronaut on a horse jumping over the moon; if AI today can draw horses jumping over the moon, each system better than last, I can see how it is tempting to conclude \u201cAGI\u201d (artificial general intelligence) must be imminent.And that is precisely what Big Tech wants you to believe. 45 minutes after announcing DALL-E 2, OpenAI\u2019s CEO Sam Altman announced on Twitter that AGI (artificial general intelligence) was going to be \u201cwild\u201d:Sam Altman @samaAGI is gonna be wild4:00 PM \u2219 Apr 6, 20221,530Likes130RetweetsAround the same time, Prafulla Dhariwal, one of the DALL-E 2 paper\u2019s authors, a researcher at OpenAI, told Technology Review that \u201cOur aim is to create general intelligence. Building models like DALL-E 2 that connect vision and language is a crucial step in our larger goal of teaching machines to perceive the world the way humans do, and eventually developing AGI.\u201d Technology Review  was so impressed they ran a story exclaiming \u201cThis horse-riding astronaut is a milestone in AI\u2019s journey to make sense of the world.\u201dNo doubt DALL-E 2 is impressive. But does it really \u201cmake sense of the world?\u201d  Those are strong words.\u00a7In my early career, I was a cognitive psychologist, and what I learned as a cognitive psychologist is that any given piece of data, on its own, can probably be explained in more than one way; and often the correct explanation is the less colorful one. If someone shows you a horse that is allegedly able to do arithmetic, you need to ask yourself, could there be another explanation? Clever Hans was such a horse, a horse that allegedly did arithmetic, but who actually turned out to do something simpler, looking to his master for (inadvertent) clues, for when to stop stomping his feet. No arithmetic there, just what you might call \u201coverclaiming.\u201d Psychology has never forgotten the lesson. Judging by all the premature declarations I have seen from the machine learning community of late, I am not sure AI has yet fully learned it.DALL-E 2 is, I dare say, not as smart as it seems. As Ernie Davis, Scott Aaronson, and I showed, a week or so after the release, it\u2019s easily fooled, especially with complex sentences and words like \u201csimilar\u201d that would require a deep understanding of language to be interpreted correctly, struggling with captions like \u201ca red basketball with flowers on it, in front of blue one with with a similar pattern\u201d:Gary Marcus \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 @GaryMarcusHow much does DALL-E have to do with AGI?

Nowadays, AI moves fast. In May, the new kid on the block arrived, Imagen. Maybe it might be better?   GoogleAI\u2019s PR department suggested that a breakthrough in the \u201cdeep level of language understanding\u201d has been achieved:Google AI @GoogleAIIntroducing Imagen, a new text-to-image synthesis model that can generate high-fidelity, photorealistic images from a deep level of language understanding. Learn more and and check out some examples of #imagen at g.co/research/Imagen 6:19 PM \u2219 May 24, 20224,026Likes894RetweetsAgainst a long history of overclaiming in AI, such strong statements demand an awful lot of evidence. Because Google won\u2019t allow skeptics to try the system, we can only make guesses. But from the few clues that have filtered out, there is enormous reason for skepticism. The first clue comes from the paper itself: some prompts are easier than others. An astronaut riding a horse, the signifier OpenAI and Tech Review made famous, is a success, and indeed Imagen is arguably even better on that than DALL-E 2\u2014which might not even have seemed possible a few weeks ago.But flip the prompt around, and the system breaks; here (on the left) are four attempts to get a horse riding an astronaut. (On the right, four attempts from a different model, displaying the same difficulty.)Every instance was a failure. The prompt itself is\u00a0a variant on an old newspaper joke; dog bites man is not news, cause it happens frequently, but man bites dog is news, because it\u2019s so rare. Horse rides astronaut is even rarer, and Imagen chokes on it.When the deep learning enthusiasts got overexcited as they usually do (\u201cdeep learning is smashing a wall\u201d was a typical Tweet), I pointed out the man bites dog issue (or more properly the horse riding astronaut issue) on Twitter.Gary Marcus \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 @GaryMarcusThe more things change, the more they stay the same. 4:10 AM \u2219 May 24, 202249Likes10RetweetsFans of deep learning fought back, ferociously. \u00a7First to reply was AI researcher Joscha Bach, who tried his best (using DALL-E as a proxy for Imagen). He half acknowledged my point, and half tried to excuse the system\u2019s bad behavior; in a whole string of tweets (sample reprinted below) he jokingly suggested that maybe Imagen just had the wrong training set:Joscha Bach @Plinz@GaryMarcus @gdb I asked #dalle to try harder and it did not work because the horse was too heavy. I think OpenAI needs to retrain the model with lighter horses? 8:18 AM \u2219 May 24, 2022198Likes10RetweetsIn another attempted rebuttal, machine learning professor Luca Ambrogioni suggested that Imagen had rejected the suggestion, because it has achieved a degree of common sense:Luca Ambrogioni @LucaAmb@GaryMarcus @GoogleAI Refusing to draw something absurd IS a sign of common sense6:18 AM \u2219 May 25, 2022Berkeley professor Gaspar Begus wondered whether the model had learned something about the distribution of different sorts of configurations of entities in the world:Ga\u0161per Begu\u0161 @begusgasper@GaryMarcus @GoogleAI Or maybe it learns that horses don\u2019t ride astronauts? \ud83d\udc0e\ud83d\ude801:41 AM \u2219 May 25, 2022Still another contributor speculated that it was a problem with annotations in the training set:Jan Czechowski @jan_czechowski@Plinz @GaryMarcus @gdb Based on this I'm thinking, if possibly whole \"horse riding an astronaut\" problem isn't just robustness to annotation errors in the training set. Model assumes mistake is more probable than intent to create this very twisted picture. Maybe enough to add \"atypically\"?4:00 AM \u2219 May 26, 2022 All good guesses, all wrong. \u00a7Turns out that the problem wasn\u2019t that horses are too heavy. (In reality, Imagen has no idea what weight, mass, or density are.) And it wasn\u2019t because current deep learning couldn\u2019t physically draw a horse riding an astronaut, or because there was some sort of anomaly in the training set, or because the prior belief about horses doing the riding was so hard to overcome that you had to invoke some kind of science fiction world. Nor was it because the system had learned that horses never ride astronauts. And, no, it wasn\u2019t about common sense at all.Instead, as Behnam Neyshabur, a scientist at Google, explained, it turns out that Imagen can draw a horse riding an astronaut\u2014but only if you ask it in precisely the right way:Behnam Neyshabur @bneyshaburIt turns out that it is possible to get this right with minimal change on the original prompt!

So simply adding \"on back of\" or \"on shoulders of\" helps increase the chance of getting it right!4:54 PM \u2219 May 25, 202261Likes1RetweetHere\u2019s the thing: this more successful attempt inadvertently disproves all the initial explanations. The problem was not that the system physically couldn\u2019t create an image of something so improbable as a horse riding astronaut, after all. Finagling the prompt shows that the system is perfectly capable. The problem was not on the image generation side, it was in the connection between language and images.That\u2019s where the deep understanding of language should live\u2014but, despite the PR, it isn\u2019t there. \u00a7At this point we need to be very careful to distinguish two questions:Can Imagen be coaxed into producing a particular image by someone fluent enough in its ways?Does Imagen have the \u201cdeep understanding of language\u201d that the paper\u2019s authors and GoogleAI\u2019s PR claims? Is that the step towards AGI that OpenAI had hoped for with DALL-E 2?The answer to the first question is a definite maybe. In this particular instance, some people who were clever and motivated enough found a way. Whether or not that is true in general remains to be seen, and will help determine whether artists stick with these systems after the novelty wears off.The answer to the second question\u2014does Imagen have a deep understanding of language\u2014is almost certainly \u201cno\u201d: if a system can draw a given picture with incantation X, but not with perfectly sensible alternative incantation Y, it\u2019s pretty hard to say that the system understands Y.Since we know that Imagen can draw images of horses riding astronauts (if the instructions are specific enough) we know that the failure to draw a horse riding an astronaut given the prompt \u201ca horse riding an astronaut\u201d can only have one explanation: the system doesn\u2019t understand what the prompt \u201ca horse riding an astronaut\u201d means. To borrow a phrase from DeepMind\u2019s Nando de Freitas, it\u2019s \u201cGame Over\u201d for that particular hypothesis.Even worse, it casts doubt on \u201can astronaut riding a horse\u201d, and suggests success there is not because the network knows how to extract meanings from individual words (\u201castronaut\u201d, \u201criding\u201d and so forth) or to combine them into semantic meanings based on their syntax (which is what linguist compositionality is all about), but rather that the network does something more holistic and approximate, a bit like keyword matching and a lot less like deep language understanding. What one really needs, and no one yet knows how to build, is a system that can derive semantics of wholes from their parts as a function of their syntax. More broadly, as Ernie Davis put it in an email to me earlier this week, \u201cthe fact that, if you play around with prompts long enough, you can eventually get what you want, is relevant to some forms of human-in-the-loop AI but it won't cut the mustard for reliable AI.\u201d\u00a7Some important caveats apply; my entire analysis is a bit like found art; it\u2019s science from the tea leaves Google deigned to share, rather than a proper experiment. Since GoogleAI hasn\u2019t let me try the system, my entire analysis is based on examples that I found in the paper and on the internet from others with access. It is certainly possible that my analysis is wrong.But I doubt it, for at least three reasons:First, the paper reported a second example of the same phenomenon, and seems to acknowledge that these man-bites-dog type sentences were systematically problematic (Imagen on left, DALL-E on right):Meanwhile, the DeWeese lab at Berkeley reported a similar kind of issue. On Twitter, they asked someone on the Imagen team to have the system draw \u201cA red conical block on top of a grey cubic block on top of a blue cylindrical block, with a green cubic block nearby.\u201dWhat they got back was telling:Good job on the red cone, and on the green cube, but the grey cubic block was a no-show, which stranded the red block on top of a blue cube (which was supposed to be a cylinder). I am pretty sure this kind of failure would be easy to replicate.Finally, there is no principled reason to think that the Imagen architecture is profoundly and relevantly different from other architectures like DALL-E 2 that have already been shown to have similar problems. In technical terms, all these systems map phrases into a space of images, but the phrases themselves are represented as strings, and not, say, as hierarchical structures such as the syntactic trees one finds in linguistics. Furthermore, there is no step in the process to try to derive such structures; so it is just wishful thinking to expect them to be fully sensitive to semantics as it relates to syntactic structure.In fact just about the only tweet I saw that didn\u2019t seem like wishful thinking came from the DeWeese lab. It rings so true I give them the last word:DeWeese Lab @DeWeeseLabLike all deep generative models today, Google's #imagen gives beautiful, convincing output, but can't understand + follow specific logical instructions. This inability to reason is a general failure point of modern ML methods and a key place to look for new ideas!

Descartes wondered whether the mind might work on hydraulic principles; throughout the second half of the 20th century, many wondered whether the digital computer would offer a natural metaphor for the mind.The latest hypothesis to attract notice, both within the scientific community, and in the world at large, is the notion that a technology that is popular today, known as large language models, such as OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3, might offer important insight into the mechanics of the human mind.\u00a0 Enthusiasm for such models has grown rapidly; OpenAI\u2019s Chief Science Officer Ilya Sutskever recently suggested that such systems could conceivably be \u201cslightly conscious\u201d. Others have begun to compare GPT with the human mind.That GPT-3, an instance of a kind of technology known as a \u201cneural network\u201d, and powered by a technique known as deep learning, appears clever is beyond question - but aside from their possible merits as engineering tools, one can ask another question: are large language models a good model of human language?\u00a7To be sure, GPT-3 is capable of constructing remarkably fluent sentences by the bushel, in response to essentially any input. If I were to tell it \u201cI am writing a story about GPT-3,\u201d it might continue with an impressively grammatical completion like \u201ca fabulous piece of computer software, developed in California.\u201dBut being grammatically fluent is one thing; being a good model for the human mind is another.\u00a0 How can one tell?Good scientific models fundamentally provide explanations; why is the sky blue? Why do objects fall towards the earth? A good theory of the human mind should explain why human nature is as it is, and why it is different from other entities (e.g., the mind of the frog). A theory of human language should help us to understand why human languages have the particular character that they do, and why for example, they differ from the kinds of artificial languages we find in computer programming and mathematics.As it happens, systems like GPT-3 provide remarkably little in the way of explanation. They don\u2019t tell us why the world is as it is; they merely mimic statistical patterns of how language has been used in their immense databases. A system like GPT can thus be quite capable of predicting how any given set of words might be continued; if you say \u201cit\u2019s a nice day; the sky is __\u201c, GPT may well anticipate that a typical human response would be to guess that the word \u201cblue\u201d likely comes next\u2014without having a basis to understand what the word blue means, or why human beings like skies that are blue.The key fact: the mere capacity to predict sequences of words doesn\u2019t, by itself, necessarily tell us much, scientifically, about why a human might in this context produce any given word. In GPT-3\u2019s case the mechanism of the prediction is essentially regurgitation; such systems are trained on literally billions of words of digital text; their gift is in finding patterns that match what they have been trained on. This is a superlative feat of statistics, but not one that means, for example, that the system knows what the words that it uses as predictive tools mean. It would not prove that a parrot knew anything about the sky, if a parrot could complete the sentence \u201cThe sky is __\u201d.One good way to move beyond merely filling in the blanks might be to ask whether the models could reliably distinguish truth from fiction. In point of fact, they can\u2019t. Rather, systems like GPT are truth-challenged, known to routinely lose coherence over long passages of text and known to fabricate endlessly. One such variant generated nonsense about covid and vaccines; the latest and greatest, InstructGPT, was recently asked to explain why it is good to eat socks after meditation and blithely invoked fictitious authorities, alleging that \u201cSome experts believe that the act of eating a sock helps the brain to come out of its altered state as a result of meditation.\u201d There is no intention to create misinformation\u2014but also no capacity to avoid it, because fundamentally, GPT-3 is a model of how words relate to one another, not a model of how language might relate to the perceived world. Human minds try to relate their language to what they know about the world; large language models don\u2019t. Which means the latter just aren\u2019t telling us much about the former.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a7A good theory of human language ought to tell us things like why all human languages have subjects and predicates, or why (as Chomsky has emphasized) sentences are invariably structure-dependent such that for example, many languages (such as English) form questions by rearranging syntactically cohesive parts, but no languages form questions by simply reversing the linear order of their words.GPT can\u2019t tell you that. The first trouble with systems like GPT-3, from the perspective of scientific explanation, is that they are equally at home mimicking human languages as they are mimicking languages that are not natural human languages (such computer programming languages), that are not naturally acquired by most humans. Systems like GPT-3 don\u2019t tell us why human languages have the special character that they do. As such, there is little explanatory value. (Imagine a physics theory that would be just as comfortable describing a world in which objects invariably scattered entirely at random as one describing a world in which gravity influenced the paths of those objects.) This is not really a new point\u2014Chomsky made essentially the same point with respect to an earlier breed of statistical models 60 years ago\u2014but it applies equally to modern AI.\u00a7Ironically though, there is a scientific lesson to be drawn from GPT-3: large language models make for an excellent testing ground for the long-standing hypothesis, perhaps most associated with British philosopher John Locke, that we might begin our lives with a slate that is virtually blank, acquiring all that we know, including our complete understanding of the world, simply by analyzing perceptual data.Such a \u201cblank slate\u201d theory might be contrasted with a more nativist theory, such as those associated with Plato and Kant, in which one might have, for example, prior knowledge about the world, such as knowledge about space or time or objects, or in the case of humans, some knowledge of universal grammar.Although there is no such thing as a truly blank slate, since all computational systems must start with some sort of algorithm in order to analyze whatever data they encounter, systems like GPT-3 come about as close to blank slates as is feasible, relying on immense amounts of experience to bootstrap whatever knowledge they might have. That experience comes in the form of exposure to billions of words of human text, scraped from the internet, and then evaluated on massive arrays of GPUs (often costing millions of dollars in computer time, and drawing immense amounts of power, and generating considerable carbon emissions).If such systems were able to infer the relation between language and the world, they would (regardless of their financial costs or ecological impact) present enormous evidence in favor of Locke\u2019s Empiricism, and also vindicate Skinner\u2019s once popular stimulus-response Behaviorism. But when they are inspected carefully, it becomes apparent that however good their impression of the statistics of human text might be, their comprehension of the world is scattershot, bound to the particulars of what input they are trained on, and lacking in genuine abstraction.This comes out most clearly in controlled experiments, in which one examines the capacity of such systems to learn abstractions, such as the arithmetical operation of addition; what Yasaman Razeghi and Sameer Singh reported, earlier this year, is that the accuracy of models like GPT-3 depends highly on the resemblance of specific tests items to the details of what does or does not appear in the database of training examples. Rather than inducing an abstract notion of addition (which is taken for granted in all modern microprocessor design) large language models learn addition piecemeal, performing markedly better on specific examples they have seen before than on examples they have not seen before. (A pocket calculator is far more systematic.) Another study showed that even in an immense neural network, with hundreds of billions of parameters, performance on simple 3-digit math problems topped out at 80%.Other studies, some formal, some less so, have looked at the capacities of such systems to understand the world; they are in many instances good at memorizing factoids (The capital of London is __), but systematically unreliable at tracking events that unfold over time. If you tell them that you have stuck a hundred pennies in your pocket and then removed three; they may get it, they may not. Still further recent studies have reported that although making these immense models ever bigger helps in some respects, on some measures of reasoning and common sense, they continue to fall short.Systems like GPT-3 aren\u2019t quite like monkeys with typewriters, but nor are they much like humans. They do not gravitate towards human language, and they never develop a cohesive undestanding of the world, no matter how much experience they have. They are an embarrassment to Locke\u2019s conjecture, and a strong argument for exploring their very antithesis, which would be Kantian systems that start with representations of space and time and causality, and at least some kernels of universal grammar. Ernie Davis and I pushed this idea in Rebooting AI; Brachmann and Levesque do even better here in the beautiful pass in their new book Machines Like Us, outlining what a minimal kernel of commonsense for an AI might look like:Humans know these things; if AI\u2019s are to understand language, they should refract language through this sort basic understanding of common sense, rather than needlessly starting as blank slates and acquiring statistics without concepts.A new breed of AI systems, with a firmer innate basis, closer to the Kantian model, but out of step with current Zeitgeist, might eventually tell us more.\u2013 Gary Marcus, Vancouver, BC, 21 May 2022Epilogue: Why does Chomsky care about GPT-3?If there is one person more critical of GPT-3 than me, it\u2019s Noam Chomsky; every time I send him an essay about systems like that, he reads the essay within minutes, and generally says I have been too soft (which is, needless to say, not the feedback that the neural community gives me). His comment on last\u2019s week essay (on Alt Intelligence), in full, reprinted with his permission:I did enjoy [your essay], but have my usual qualms.\u00a0 Take GPT-3 \u2013 I\u2019m sure you saw the lead article in the NYT magazine collapsing in awe about its ability to mimic some regularities in data.\u00a0 In fact, its only achievement is to use up a lot of California\u2019s energy.\u00a0 You can\u2019t go to a physics conference and say: I\u2019ve got a great theory.\u00a0 It accounts for everything and is so simple it can be captured in two words: \u201cAnything goes.\u201dAll known and unknown laws of nature are accommodated, no failures.\u00a0 Of course, everything impossible is accommodated also.That\u2019s GPT-3.\u00a0 Works as well or better for 45 terabytes of data from impossible languages.It\u2019s been understood forever that a theory has to answer two kinds of questions: Why this?\u00a0 Why not that?NoamWhat is Chomsky on about? To really appreciate where he is coming from, you have to understand a bit of the history of linguistics, and his own role in developing the field. Before Chomsky, most of what linguists did was to describe language, rather than to explain it; one might, for example, characterize the grammar of English, or Japanese, or Swahili, perhaps focusing on some lesser known aspect of their grammar.Chomsky found that description, in of itself, dissatisfying, and wanted to ask a different question: why was human language the way that it is? Why do we speak in human languages, rather than say programming languages? Why are there commonalities across many different languages? (Chomsky\u2019s hypothesis: all humans, regardless of culture, acquire language in way that is governed by universal grammar.)It\u2019s one thing, Chomsky argued, to catalog all the world\u2019s flowers, and another to try to understand what it is about biology that makes us have the flowers that we do have rather than something entirely different. Same thing with language: catalog, versus explanation.Chomsky spent a large part of his career trying to get people to think about why human language is the way that it is.The why question, is to be sure, incredibly difficult, in part because no other extant species has anything remotely like it, and in part because we don\u2019t (and shouldn\u2019t) do invasive studies in which we carve open living human brains or (e.g.) teach humans artificial languages in lieu of natural languages in order to better understand the underlying mechanisms.But the question of why human language is as it is remains one of the most important questions a scientist could ask: humans are truly unique, and their signature trait is the way that they turn sound (or gesture) into meaning, enabling culture and technology transmission at unprecedented scale. From the perspective of science, it would be a tremendous advance if we could understand how humans come to do that, what machinery enables children to do what our best computers still can\u2019t do, and how the capacity to learn language evolved. (It would likely also have considerable payoff for engineering, but that\u2019s a story for another day.)If Chomsky\u2019s more than a little disappointed about by the attention surrounding systems like GPT-3, it\u2019s because all this emphasis on statistical machines has distracted away from the incredibly important questions about the very nature of human language and cognition that he spent his career rightly trying to call attention to. His questions still deserve answers, and it is difficult to see how GPT-3 casts any light on them. Large language models can, parasitically, glom onto human data, but they could glom onto any other data set just as well (e.g. programming languages); as such, they tell us far too little about how humans have come to be what they are.That matters.SubscribePS.

John McCarthy, one of the co-founders of AI, wrote groundbreaking papers on why AI needed common sense; Marvin Minsky, another of the field\u2019s co-founders of AI wrote a book scouring the human mind for inspiration, and clues for how to build a better AI. Herb Simon won a Nobel Prize for behavioral economics. One of his key books  was called Models of Thought, which aimed to explain how \u201cNewly developed computer languages express theories of mental processes, so that computers can then simulate the predicted human behavior.\u201dA large fraction of current AI researchers, or at least those currently in power, don\u2019t (so far as I can tell) give a damn about any of this.  Instead, the current focus is on what I will call (with thanks to Naveen Rao for the term) Alt Intelligence.  Alt Intelligence isn\u2019t about building machines that solve problems in ways that have to do with human intelligence.  It\u2019s about using massive amounts of data \u2013 often derived from human behavior \u2013 as a substitute for intelligence.  Right now, the predominant strand of work within Alt Intelligence is the idea of scaling. The notion that the bigger the system, the closer we come to true intelligence, maybe even consciousness. There is nothing new, per se, about studying Alt Intelligence, but the hubris associated with it is.  I\u2019ve seen signs for a while, in the dismissiveness with which the current AI superstars, and indeed vast segments of the whole field of AI, treat human cognition, ignoring and even ridiculing scholars in such fields as linguistics, cognitive psychology, anthropology, and philosophy. But this morning I woke to a new reification, a Twitter thread that expresses, out loud, the Alt Intelligence creed, from Nando de Freitas, a brilliant high-level executive at DeepMind, Alphabet\u2019s rightly-venerated AI wing, in a declaration that AI is \u201call about scale now.\u201d Indeed, in his mind (perhaps deliberately expressed with vigor to be provocative), the harder challenges in AI are already solved. \u201cThe Game is Over!\u201d, he declares:Nando de Freitas \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 @NandoDFSomeone\u2019s opinion article.

But are we any closer to AGI?8:46 AM \u2219 May 14, 2022120Likes19RetweetsThere\u2019s nothing wrong, per se, with pursuing Alt Intelligence. Alt Intelligence represents an intuition (or more properly, a family of intuitions) about how to build intelligent systems, and since nobody yet knows how to build any kind of system that matches the flexibility and resourcefulness of human intelligence, it\u2019s certainly fair game for people to pursue multiple different hypotheses about how to get there. Nando de Freitas is about as in-your-face as possible about defending that hypothesis, which I will refer to as Scaling-Uber-Alles.  Of course, that name, Scaling-Uber-Alles, is not entirely fair. De Freitas knows full well (as I will discuss below) that you can\u2019t just make the models bigger and hope for success. People have been doing a lot of scaling lately, and achieved some great successes, but also run into some road blocks. Let\u2019s take a dose reality, before going further, into how de Freitas faces facts.A Dose of RealitySystems like DALL-E 2, GPT-3, Flamingo, and Gato appear to be mind-blowing, but nobody who has looked at them carefully would confuse them for human intelligence. DALL-E 2, for example, can often create fantastic artwork, from verbal descriptions \u201can astronaut riding a horse in a photorealistic style\u201d:But it\u2019s also pretty prone to surprising stumbles, like this uncomprehending reply to \u201ca red cube on top of a blue cube\u201d. [DALL-E\u2019s responses, created by a network called unCLIP, are on the left of the figure; interestingly a predecessor model, shown on the right, actually does better on this particular item.]When Ernest Davis, Scott Aaronson, and I probed in a bit more detail, we found a number of similar examples:Similarly, the ostensibly amazing Flamingo has (not unrelated) bugs of its own, captured in a candid and important thread by DeepMind\u2019s Murray Shanahan, with further examples from Flamingo\u2019s lead author Jean-Baptiste Alayrac. For example, Shanahan confronted Flamingo with this image:and wound up having this discomprehending dialogue:Murray Shanahan @mpshanahanAnd this was the conversation we had about it:\nFlamingo: This is a traffic light. It is red.\nUser: Can you see three circles?\nFlamingo: Yes, I can see three circles.\nUser: What colours are they?\nFlamingo: They are red, blue and green.\n5/92:44 PM \u2219 May 10, 2022Murray Shanahan @mpshanahanUser: Where is the green circle?\nFlamingo: The green circle is on the right.\nUser: Really? On the right of what?\nFlamingo: The green circle is on the right of the blue circle.\n6/92:44 PM \u2219 May 10, 2022Um no. DeepMind\u2019s newest star, just unveiled, Gato, is capable of cross-modal feats never seen before in AI, but still, when you look in the fine print, remains stuck in the same land of unreliability, moments of brilliance coupled with absolute discomprehension: Of course, it\u2019s not uncommon for defenders of deep learning to make the reasonable point that humans make errors, too.But anyone who is candid will recognize that these kinds of errors reveal that something is, for now, deeply amiss. If either of my children routinely made errors like these, I would, no exaggeration, drop everything else I am doing, and bring them to the neurologist, immediately.So let\u2019s be honest: scaling hasn\u2019t worked yet. But it might, or so de Freitas\u2019s theory\u2014a clear expression of the Zeitgeist\u2014goes. Scaling-Uber-AllesSo how does de Freitas reconcile reality with ambition? Literally billions of dollars have been poured into Transformers, the underlying technology that drives GPT-3, Gato, and so many others; training data sets have expanded from megabytes to gigabytes, parameter counts from millions to trillions. And yet the discomprehending errors, well-documented in numerous works since 1988, remain.To some (such as myself), the abiding problem of discomprehension might\u2014despite the immense progress\u2014signal the need for a fundamental rethink, such as the one that Davis and I offered in our book Rebooting AI. But not to de Freitas (nor to many others in the field\u2014I don\u2019t mean to single him out; I just think he has given prominent and explicit voice to what many are thinking).In the opening thread he elaborates much of his view about reconciling reality with current troubles, \u201cIt\u2019s about making these models bigger, safer, compute efficient, faster at sampling, smarter memory, more modalities, INNOVATIVE DATA, on/offline\u201d. Critically, not a word (except, perhaps \u201csmarter memory\u201d) is given to any idea from cognitive psychology, linguistics, or philosophy.The rest of de Freitas\u2019 thread, follows suit:Nando de Freitas \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 @NandoDFSolving these scaling challenges is what will deliver AGI. Research focused on these problems, eg S4 for greater memory, is needed. Philosophy about symbols isn\u2019t. Symbols are tools in the world and big nets have no issue creating them and manipulating them 2/n8:50 AM \u2219 May 14, 202247Likes3RetweetsThis is, again, a pure statement of scaling-\u00fcber-alles, and marks its target: the ambition here is not just better AI, but AGI.AGI, artificial general intelligence, is the community\u2019s shorthand for AI that is at least as good, and resourceful, and wide-ranging, as human intelligence. The signature success of narrow artificial intelligence, and indeed alt intelligence, writ large, has been games like Chess (DeepBlue owed nothing to human intelligence) and Go (AlphaGo similarly owed little to human intelligence). De Freitas has far more ambitious goals in mind, and, to his credit, he\u2019s upfront about them.The means to his end? Again, de Freitas\u2019s emphasis is mainly technical tools for accommodating bigger data sets. The idea that other ideas, e.g., from philosphy or cognitive science, might be important is dismissed. (\u201cPhilosophy about symbols isn\u2019t [needed]\u201d is perhaps a rebuttal to my long-standing campaign to integrate symbol-manipulation into cognitive science and AI, recently resumed in Nautilus Magazine, though the argument is not fully spelled out. Responding briefly: His statement that \u201c[neural] nets have no issue creating [symbols] and manipulating them\u201d misses both history and reality. The history missed is the the fact that many neural net enthusiasts, have argued against symbols for decades, and the reality that is missed is the above-documented fact that symbolic descriptions like \u201cred cube on blue cube\u201d still elude the state-of-the-art in 2022.)De Freitas\u2019s Twitter manifesto closes with an approving reference to Rich Sutton\u2019s famous white paper, The Bitter Lesson:Nando de Freitas \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 @NandoDFRich Sutton is right too, but the AI lesson ain\u2019t bitter but rather sweet. I learned it from @geoffreyhinton a decade ago. Geoff predicted what was predictable with uncanny clarity.9:24 AM \u2219 May 14, 202232Likes1RetweetSutton\u2019s argument is that the only thing that has led to advances in AI is more data, computed over more effectively. Sutton is, in my view, only half right, almost correct with his account of the past, but dubious with his inductive prediction about the future. So far, in most domains (not all, to be sure) Big Data has triumphed (for now) over careful knowledge engineering. But,Virtually all of the world\u2019s software, from web browsers to spreadsheets to word processors, still depends on knowledge engineering, and Sutton sells that short. To take one example, Sumit Gulwani\u2019s brilliant Flash Fill feature is a one-trial learning system that is staggeringly useful, and not at all founded on the premise of large data, but rather on classical programming techniques. I don\u2019t think any pure deep learning/big data system can match it. Virtually none of the critical problems for AI that cognitive scientists such as Steve Pinker, Judea Pearl, the late Jerry Fodor, and myself have been pointing to for decades is actually solved yet. Yes, machines can play games really well, and deep learning has made massive contributions to domains like speech recognition. But no current AI is remotely close to being able to read an arbitrary text with enough comprehension to be able to build a model of what a speaker is saying and intends to accomplish, nor able (a la Star Trek Computer) to be able to reason about an arbitrary problem and produce a cohesive responsive. We are in early days in AI. Success on a few problems with a particular strategy in no way guarantees that we can solve all problems in a similar way. It is sheer inductive folly to imagine otherwise, particular when the failure modes (unreliability, bizarre errors, failures in compositionality and discomprehension) have not changed since Fodor and Pinker pointed them out (in separate articles) in 1988. In closingLet me close by saying that I am heartened to see that, thankfully, Scaling-\u00dcber-Alles isn\u2019t fully consensus yet, even at DeepMind: Murray Shanahan @mpshanahanMy opinion: Maybe scaling is enough. Maybe. And we definitely need to do all the things @NandoDF lists. But I see very little in Gato to suggest scaling alone will get us to human-level generalisation. It falls so far short.

It may just be that the best path to artificial (general) intelligence isn\u2019t through Alt Intelligence, after all. As I have written, I am fine with thinking of Gato as an \u201cAlt Intelligence\u201d\u2014 an interesting exploration in alternative ways to build intelligence\u2014but we need to take it in context: it doesn\u2019t work like the brain, it doesn\u2019t learn like a child, it doesn\u2019t understand language, it doesn\u2019t align with human values, and it can\u2019t be trusted with mission-critical tasks. It may well be better than anything else we currently have, but the fact that it still doesn\u2019t really work, even after all the immense investments that have been made in it, should give us pause.And really, it should lead us back to where the founders of AI started. AI should certainly not be a slavish replica of human intelligence (which after all is flawed in its own ways, saddled with lousy memory and cognitive bias). But it should look to human (and animal cognition) for clues. No, the Wright Brothers didn\u2019t mimic birds, but they learned something from avian flight control. Knowing what to borrow and what not is likely to be more than half the battle.The bottom line is this, something that AI once cherished but has now forgotten: If we are to build AGI, we are going to need to learn something from humans, how they reason and understand the physical world, and how they represent and acquire language and complex concepts. It is sheer hubris to believe otherwise.SubscribeP.S. Please subscribe if you\u2019d like to read more no-bullshit analysis of the current state of AI."}
